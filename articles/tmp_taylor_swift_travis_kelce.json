La Swift \u00e8 solita incontrare i suoi fan dopo i suoi concerti, ma non lo ha fatto durante l'Eras Tour (visto che si esibisce per tre ore o pi\u00f9 ogni sera).\n\n\"Mi ha deluso il fatto che non parli prima o dopo i suoi spettacoli, perch\u00e9 deve risparmiare la voce per le 44 canzoni che canta\", dice Kelce, confessando di essere rimasto \"un po' ferito\" per non aver potuto chiacchierare con lei. \"Non incontra nessuno, o almeno non voleva incontrare me, quindi l'ho presa sul personale\", scherza.\n\nUNIVERSAL MUSIC GROUP TAYLOR SWIFT 11 \u20ac su Amazon Credit: Courtesy Photo\n\nTHE FASHION EDIT Ballerine in rete rosse courtesy photo Costume intero nero courtesy photo Borsa tracolla uncinetto courtesy photo Pantaloni in misto lino courtesy photo",

Ma nel caso in cui aveste dubbi, Kelce ha partecipato a un podcast dove ha parlato per 10 minuti di quanto sia orgoglioso della \u00abmia ragazza. Questa \u00e8 la mia donna\u00bb.\n\nNell\u2019ultimo episodio di Bussin\u2019 With the Boys, un podcast condotto dagli ex giocatori della NFL Will Compton e Taylor Lewan, uscito marted\u00ec, Kelce ha fatto la sua migliore imitazione dell\u2019emoji con gli occhi a cuore mentre parlava della sua famosissima fidanzata (ha anche parlato di football, certo, ma diciamo le cose come stanno). Secondo le note del programma, l\u2019intervista \u00e8 stata registrata il 19 giugno, quindi prima dell\u2019esibizione a sorpresa di Kelce in cilindro e frac durante l\u2019Eras Tour.\n\nDi particolare rilievo \u00e8 stato il racconto di Kelce sul motivo per cui \u00abho iniziato a innamorarmi davvero di lei\u00bb: il giocatore ha detto che, pur essendo consapevole del proprio alto profilo, Swift \u00e8 anche perfettamente capace di mettere a proprio agio le persone e di non distogliere l\u2019attenzione dai momenti importanti per gli altri, come la vittoria del Super Bowl da parte dei Chiefs.\n\n\u00ab\u00c8 molto consapevole di s\u00e9, ma allo stesso tempo (\u2026) capisce situazioni del genere\u00bb, ha detto Kelce di Swift. \u00abE credo sia per questo che ho iniziato a innamorarmi davvero di lei, per quanto \u00e8 autentica quand\u2019\u00e8 con gli amici e con la famiglia. Per una persona tanto al centro dell\u2019attenzione le cose possono diventare pazzesche, invece lei si mantiene assolutamente tranquilla e rilassata, ed \u00e8 una cosa che ammiro senz\u2019altro\u00bb.\n\nI commenti di Kelce non sono che l\u2019ultima forma di manifestazione pubblica di affetto della coppia. Per limitarsi agli ultimi cinque giorni: i due hanno immortalato la loro relazione sotto forma di selfie con tre eredi al trono; Taylor ha indossato un anello TNT mentre si esibiva; Travis ha portato in braccio Taylor sul palco davanti a migliaia di fan urlanti, tra cui Sir Paul McCartney (e non dimentichiamo il bacio non troppo discreto che lei ha lanciato a Travis prima che lui e le sue enormi Louboutin lasciassero il palco); Taylor ha pubblicato su Instagram le foto della suddetta salita sul palco e ha detto ai suoi 283 milioni di follower di stare \u00abancora \u00abscompisciandosi/delirando per il debutto di @killatrav nell\u2019Eras Tour \ud83e\udd70\u00bb; mentre Gigi Hadid ha regalato a Taylor un anello personalizzato in stile Super Bowl con varie \u00abcose preferite\u00bb della cantante, tra cui il ritratto di uno dei suoi gatti (Benjamin Button, sei tu il prescelto) e il numero di casacca di Travis, l\u201987.\n\nNe abbiamo fatta di strada da quella prima partita dei Bears e dal commento di Kelce del novembre 2023 in cui spiegava che cercava di mantenere il riserbo per \u00abnon rischiare di dire qualcosa che possa allontanare Taylor\u00bb.\n\n\u00abOvviamente non ho mai frequentato nessuno con un\u2019aura simile\u2026 Non mi era mai capitato\u00bb, aveva detto all\u2019epoca. \u00abAllo stesso tempo, per\u00f2, non me ne sto affatto allontanando a gambe levate\u2026 L\u2019attenzione che riceve, la lente d\u2019ingrandimento che si ritrova puntata addosso ogni singolo giorno, i paparazzi fuori da casa sua, fuori da ogni ristorante in cui va, dopo ogni volo che prende\u2026 eppure lei continua a vivere e a godersi la vita. Se lei si comporta cos\u00ec, \u00e8 meglio che non sia io a comportarmi in modo strano\u00bb.",

Il giocatore di football americano \u2013 che \u00e8 amatissimo negli Stati Uniti \u2013 ha pensato bene di comprare alla sua \"Tay\" vari capi firmati Valentino, Prada, Bottega Veneta e Fendi che sono i marchi preferiti dalla popstar.\n\nSecondo la fonte citata da The Sun US, il giocatore avrebbe acquistato ben 14 capi tra cui un vestito a paillettes di Valentino da 16 mila dollari (14 mila euro), una borsa color vinaccia sempre di Valentino del valore di 3.330 dollari (pi\u00f9 di 3 mila euro) e un'altra borsa di rafia sempre dello stilista italiano che costa pi\u00f9 di 1.630 dollari (oltre 1.500 euro).\n\nPer quanto riguarda Prada e Bottega Veneta, Travis ha scelto alcuni vestiti in tweed con bottoni e cerniere laterali e scarpe con il tacco che costano migliaia di dollari.\n\nL'amore di Taylor per l'Italia\n\nSwift e Kelce si sono letteralmente innamorati dell'Italia tanto che, durante una pausa di alcuni giorni tra una tappa e l'altra del tour europeo, hanno alloggiato a Villa Sola Cabiati a Tremezzo e, secondo i media statunitensi, starebbero cercando casa proprio a Como.\n\nStando a quanto scrive il The Sun, la coppia starebbero considerando tre ville: la prima non lontano da Bellagio che costerebbe 3,2 milioni di euro; la seconda del valore di 1,7 milioni di euro si troverebbe a Menaggio, mentre, la localit\u00e0 della terza tenuta da 7,4 milioni di euro non \u00e8 stata resa nota, si sa soltanto che si pu\u00f2 accedere solo dal lago.\n\nUltimo aggiornamento: Domenica 21 Luglio 2024, 19:13\n\n\u00a9 RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA",

Sembra che stiano accelerando. Direi entro sei mesi\u00bb, ha riferito Dave Portnoy, fondatore di Barstool Sports e Swiftie convinto in esclusiva a Page Six.

Anche se quel tentativo non \u00e8 andato a buon fine, ha attirato l'attenzione di Taylor.\n\nI due hanno iniziato a frequentarsi nell'estate del 2023, e Swift ha fatto la sua prima apparizione a una partita dei Chiefs a settembre dello stesso anno.

Dal suo arrivo iconico al Super Bowl in un completo brillantinato firmato Amiri, alle sue apparizioni nei talk show in abiti su misura, il giocatore sta ridefinendo lo stile dell'atleta moderno.\n\nLa relazione con Taylor Swift ha portato Kelce sotto i riflettori in modo senza precedenti per un giocatore NFL. E lui ha dimostrato di saper gestire questa attenzione extra dimostrando di essere a suo agio tanto davanti alle telecamere quanto sul campo da gioco.\n\nCon apparizioni in spot pubblicitari di alto profilo, un podcast di successo e persino voci di potenziali progetti televisivi, insomma, Kelce sta dimostrando di essere molto pi\u00f9 di un semplice atleta.

Durante la registrazione di un episodio del podcast New Heights, condotto insieme al fratello Jason e con il rapper Lil Dicky come ospite, Kelce ha scherzosamente dichiarato di non sapere come abbia conquistato la fidanzata.\n\nL\u2019ironia di Kelce risiede nel fatto che la Swift, al tempo in cui si sono incontrati, non era affatto appassionata dello sport, un aspetto che potrebbe sembrare inusuale per la compagna di un atleta di alto livello. Tuttavia Lil Dicky ha sottolineato che la loro storia d\u2019amore rispecchia un classico americano. Una sorta di film gi\u00e0 visto in cui la pop star pi\u00f9 famosa incontra l\u2019atleta pi\u00f9 amato e se ne innamora.\n\nLa relazione tra Kelce e Swift ha iniziato a destare interesse e curiosit\u00e0 gi\u00e0 nel settembre del 2023, quando la cantante ha partecipato a una partita di NFL per sostenere Kelce. Da allora, la loro storia sembra procedere senza intoppi, con entrambi i partner che godono di una crescente popolarit\u00e0 e apprezzamento da parte dei fan.\n\nKelce, interrogato su come si sente ad avere guadagnato cos\u00ec tanti nuovi fan, ha risposto con un tono divertito, sottolineando che sta vivendo pienamente la sua vita e che la relazione con Swift ha contribuito a portare nuovo interesse nel mondo del football. Questa unione tra due mondi diversi ha infatti permesso loro di esplorare nuove sfide e opportunit\u00e0, aprendo anche il mondo del football a nuovi orizzonti. Kelce ha sostenuto: \u201cMi sto divertendo tantissimo nella vita. Stiamo portando nuovo interesse nel mondo del football e aprendo anche il mondo del football a cose nuove\u201d.",

Since then, Regan's become a fixture at the 34 year old's home, even getting to know Swift as she hangs out during Kelce's haircuts.\n\nOn the podcast, Regan shared his thoughts on Swift's relationship with his friend, commenting: \"It's kind of cool to see because I know her as a person. She's very interested in what you're saying. She doesn't act like the most famous celebrity in the world. She's a very nice person, and she's a good girlfriend to my friend so it's pretty cool, it doesn't seem too crazy to me.\"\n\nImage: @patty_cuts/Instagram) @patty_cuts/Instagram)",
