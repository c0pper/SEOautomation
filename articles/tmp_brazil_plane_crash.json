Voepass said 58 passengers and four crew members were on board.\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s state fire brigade confirmed on social media that a plane crashed in the city of Vinhedo, and that it has sent seven crews to the region of the accident.\n\nAccording to the Flight Radar website, the plane was traveling at 17,000 feet before plunging 4,000 feet in two minutes, and then its GPS signal was lost.\n\nVideo shared on social media showed what appeared to be the plane plunging down into a cluster of trees, followed by a large plume of black smoke.\n\nAnother clip showed flames and smoke coming from the plane fuselage where it had apparently plowed into the side of a house. Burning debris and at least one body could be seen strewn across the gardens of a residential area, while emergency vehicles arrived.\n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Air Force reported that it has sent a team of investigators to the site.\n\nMore details soon \u2026",

He said that it appeared that all passengers and crew aboard had died, without elaborating as to how that information had been obtained.\n\nFlight tracker FlightRadar24 said on social media that it was \"currently processing granular data from this flight.\"\n\nWe are following reports of a crash of a VoePass ATR 72 near S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.

FlightRadar said the aircraft was flying at an altitude of 17,000 feet just before the crash.\n\nThe crash comes less than a year after 12 people, including a baby, died in a plane crash in the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.",
