Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nAcer\n\nAugust is here, and if you're a parent, you're probably deep into back-to-school shopping for your kids.

Shop now and you can save up to 52% off from retailers such as Amazon, Walmart and Target today.\n\nBest deals on back-to-school items\n\nFrom low-cost Windows laptops and Chromebooks, headphones, dorm room bedding, dorm room TVs, dorm refrigerators and other essentials, to school supplies and other back-to-school necessities, we found the best deals at your favorite retailers.\n\nBack-to-school tech deals\n\nCheck out these deals on laptops, tablets, wireless earbuds and more.\n\nApple iPad (9th generation): $249 (24% off)\n\nAmazon\n\nAt the moment, the iPad (9th generation) is the least expensive iPad you can buy. It relies on older technology, but it runs the latest version of the iPadOS operating system and comes with the same collection of preinstalled apps included with all current model iPads. This model also allows users to download and install additional apps from the App Store.\n\nIts performance is a bit slower than newer models, and its screen offers a lower resolution. And the tablet also runs using an older processor. Yet, for a young user, this version of the iPad is more than adequate.\n\nIf you plan to give the iPad to a young child, we highly recommend a kid-friendly, full-body case to protect it from accidental spills, drops and other potential damage.\n\nFor a younger user, the iPad 9th generation is a great entry-level option. For more help choosing the perfect iPad for the person you're shopping for, be sure to read our 2024 Apple iPad buyer's guide.\n\nApple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation): $190 (24% off)\n\n\n\nAmazon\n\nRight now, the AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) are Apple's most advanced and best-sounding wireless earbuds. These were our top pick within our 2024 Apple AirPods buyer's guide, and for good reason. They also fared well in our roundup of the six best wireless earbuds with spatial audio in 2024.\n\nThese earbuds are ideal for Apple enthusiasts and students of all ages. Key features include spatial audio with dynamic head tracking and support of Dolby Atmos. Their noise-canceling technology works exceptionally well.\n\nThe design of the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) is fairly similar to the previous generation, but Apple has introduced touch controls to the stems of these earbuds.

The audio instantly adapts when you move your head.\n\n14\" MacBook Pro with M3 processor: Save $200\n\nAmazon\n\nFor college students on a budget, but who want an Apple laptop, a MacBook Air is fine. But if you need more power and speed, get his 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 processor. This is the least powerful of Apple's new lineup of M3 processors, which includes the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max, but with its 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU, it offers more than enough speed and power for the typical student. (And it blows away any of the M1 or M2 processors featured in the MacBook Air or older MacBook Pro models.)\n\nYou also get a high-resolution Liquid Retina XDR display that offers a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits. For wireless connectivity, this MacBook Pro supports Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. It's also bundled with two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, an SDXC memory card slot, an HDMI port and a headphone jack. The laptop's keyboard is backlit and includes a TouchID sensor, so you can unlock it and approve online purchases with a quick fingerprint scan.\n\nOne of the most appealing features of the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 processor is its up-to-22-hour battery life.

It's currently on sale for 27% off, so it can be added to a dorm room for just $330.

That means it can turn content into near-4K quality for an even more crisp viewing experience. Its UHD resolution and HDR 10+ support mean beautiful colors and deep black shades as well, so whether you use it for TV, movies, gaming or even work, you've got a crystal clear picture that's more than easy on the eyes.\n\nPlus, you can mount it or use its height-adjustable stand that tilts and pivots to make sure no matter where you have to put it in your small space, you get a great viewing angle.

They last through early September. Unlike Labor Day or Memorial Day, which lasts a few days, the back to school season lasts for multiple weeks. However, keep in mind that some of the best sales tend to occur in August. By the time September begins, most of the highly sought after deals have expired or simply gone out of stock.\n\nWhere are the best back to school sales? Laptops, Bluetooth speakers, Chromebooks, and tablets are among the best back to school sales you'll find during the back to school season. Some of our favorite laptops, such as the MacBook Air M2, are already seeing price cuts of up to $200. Meanwhile, stores like Walmart and Wayfair are slashing the price of various dorm room essentials like coffee makers, cheap bedding sets, and more.",

                "text": "Time flies when you're having fun. Somehow, the time of camps and lazy mornings watching TV is almost over, and school is around the corner (if it hasn't started already). We hunted down discounts on school supplies and classroom essentials, which, in this day and age, aren't just backpacks and glue sticks. Everyone can benefit from these deals on headphones, tablets, and other gadgets.\n\nBe sure to check out our Best Dorm Gear guide for additional recommendations and gift ideas, plus the Best Student Discounts and Best Teacher Discounts.\n\nSpecial offer for Gear readers: Get WIRED for just $5 ($25 off). This includes unlimited access to WIRED.com, full Gear coverage, and subscriber-only newsletters. Subscriptions help fund the work we do every day.\n\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\nTech Deals\n\nOur guides on the Best Laptops, Best Tablets, and Best Earbuds can help you decide.\n\nPhotograph: Brenda Stolyar\n\nThis iteration from March 2024 is our favorite MacBook for most people. The newest MacBook Air (7/10, WIRED Recommends) isn't terribly different from older iterations, but it's steady and reliable when it comes to everyday tasks like doing your schoolwork or catching up on House of the Dragon. It's not the best for graphics-intensive tasks, but if you are in the market for a laptop that can handle your daily to-do list, this is a solid option at the lowest price we've tracked. The 15-inch version is also discounted.\n\nYou can pair the 16-inch MacBook Pro with either the M3 Pro or M3 Max chip. This version has the M3 Max, which is overkill if you mostly just use a web browser. But if you're a content creator, our reviewer Christopher Null notes that its performance is measurably better. Just make sure you're getting 32 GB of unified memory\u201416 isn't enough.\n\nThis Asus ZenBook 14 (7/10, WIRED Review) is an affordable, no-nonsense ultralight laptop that is our favorite cheap laptop. It has great performance, great battery life, and an OLED screen, for a very reasonable price.\n\nPhotograph: Nena Farrell\n\nThe Google Pixel Tablet (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite tablet-smart-display-combo. The 11-inch LCD screen is sharp, and the operating system is fun to use. The included charging dock doubles as a speaker, and it converts the tablet into a smart display. The Pixel Tablet also supports Chromecast so you can cast music or shows to it from your device. There's also support for up to eight multiple users, which might come in handy for big families or small classrooms.\n\nThe ninth-generation iPad (8/10, WIRED Recommends) isn't the newest or most powerful model, but it's still a great basic and affordable iPad. It still has a Home button with Touch ID, and it's compatible with some older accessories like the first-generation Apple Pencil. If you want an iPad but you're on a very tight budget, this is a fine option.\n\nPhotograph: Rain Design\n\nThe discount might not seem that stellar, but this price comes within $4 of the best we've seen, and the stand usually sells for $60. This is our pick for the most portable laptop stand. It's sturdy and lightweight, and it folds down when you're done using it.\n\nSo here's the thing about the Sony Linkbuds (8/10, WIRED Recommends): They always sell for either $178 or $128, with very few deviations. It's a pattern that's been going since June of last year. But right now, they're $128, making it a better time to purchase than the next time they vacillate back and forth in price. They're excellent wireless earbuds, partially due to the design, which allows you to hear what's going on around you.\n\nThe only truly bad thing about the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is their name. They've got excellent noise canceling, 30 hours of battery life, a comfortable (if a little drab) design, and fantastic sound and mic quality. They've since been replaced by the newer, more premium XM5, but the XM4 are still some of the best headphones you can buy. We've seen this deal a few times in the past, but the headphones rarely drop much lower than this.\n\nThis itty-bitty power bank isn't listed in our Best Portable Chargers guide, but we generally like gear from Zendure, and the price is absolutely bonkers. This charger is available in a ton of cool colors and the small form factor makes it easy to take anywhere. It has pass-through charging and can top off two devices simultaneously through its USB-A and USB-C ports. It'll charge your gear up quickly, too.\n\nBackpack and Tote Deals\n\nPhotograph: The North Face\n\nThe North Face Jester is our favorite backpack for school. Various colors are on sale for around $20, some of which don't drop in price very often. We like the exterior bungee and the roomy interior, and the bag is made of recycled components which is always nice. The bag also stays nicely balanced no matter how much stuff you cram in it.\n\nThis bag is in our Best Backpacks guide and our Best Recycled Bags guide. It saves 22 plastic bottles from landfills, and there's a detachable insert to convert the bag's interior into one that's roomier or one with more pockets. We've seen it drop to about $10 less before, but this deal is still a good one.\n\nThe Rains Backpack Mini is an excellent, stylish, waterproof backpack. It has a grown-up aesthetic and enough room to hold a 13-inch laptop as well as a few other essentials. The 8.5-liter capacity isn't going to be ideal for kids with a ton of stuff to carry, but for teachers and older students, it's definitely worth a look.\n\nHome Office and Dorm Deals\n\nPhotograph: Staples\n\nThe Hyken is the best budget office chair. It goes on sale often, but rarely for this low. It reclines and the back is made of a breathable mesh fabric. There's added lumbar support and a headrest as well. If your college-bound kid wants a wider seat, check out our other recommendations.\n\nThe Nest Wifi Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is simple to set up and has a cute, unobtrusive design, and the Google Home app lets you customize settings. The three-pack will cover up to 2,200 square feet of your son's frat house, but you can snag smaller packs if the space isn't so large. Read more about this in our Best Mesh Routers guide.\n\nThe Deco X20 is our favorite budget mesh Wi-Fi system. It's easy to set up and has great parental controls. The coverage speeds aren't top-of-the-line, but the system is dependable and affordable\u2014especially thanks to this deal.\n\nDeals on Everything Else\n\nPhotograph: Ember\n\nWe've featured this mug in some winter-themed gift guides in the past. Few things are more frustrating than pouring yourself a cup of coffee, getting distracted by a work-related task, and taking a sip only to find that your brew has gone cold. Ember's smart mug fixes that problem. It'll keep beverages warm for up to 80 minutes on a full charge, or all day if you leave the coaster plugged in. It also has automatic shut-off for peace of mind.\n\nDisinfectant wipes, glue sticks, dry-erase markers, and oodles of other supplies are on sale thanks to this promotion at Amazon. If you spend $50 on eligible school supplies, you'll automatically get $10 off during checkout. This is an especially good way to save on teacher supply lists.\n\nJoin Target Circle for free and verify with your student or faculty ID to get 20 percent off a qualifying purchase. That includes everything in your cart that's eligible. There are a few excluded items, but most school supplies and classroom essentials are eligible for the discount.\n\nThis sale at Happy Planner features tons of products, including some planners that cover 2024\u20132025. With planner prices hovering around $10, it's a good way to snag the best weekly planner for much cheaper than usual. Other discounted products include organizational tools for your desk and stickers that might make great teacher gifts.",

                "text": "5 tips to save money on back-to-school shopping \u2014 this weekend and beyond\n\ntoggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nAs summer comes to a close, back-to-school shopping enters full swing.\n\nAmerican families with kids from elementary to high school are expected to spend an average of $875 on back-to-school items, according to the National Retail Federation's annual back-to-school survey.\n\nThe high price tag for new clothes, laptops and pencils can feel intimidating, especially as families struggle with inflation. We asked some retail experts for advice and compiled five ways to reduce the cost of back-to-school shopping.\n\n\n\nPlan around tax-free shopping dates\n\nSeventeen states offer sales-tax holidays throughout the back-to-school shopping season. This weekend, people in nine states (Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia) will be able to save on school supplies, clothing, electronics and more.\n\n\"Definitely a good time to stock up, especially if you need bigger-ticket items like a computer, iPad, things like that,\" said Ashley Patrick, founder of Budgets Made Easy, a personal finance blog for families. \"You can save 7 to 9 or more percent, depending on what state you're in that is doing it, so that's a huge savings right off the top.\u201d\n\nThe eligible categories and maximum savings vary by state, but details can be found on a list compiled by the Federation of Tax Administrators.\n\nSpread out shopping\n\nWhile it may feel more convenient, checking off your entire list in one shopping trip is often less cost-effective. Visiting multiple stores over the course of a few weeks ensures that you can access all the different promotions.\n\n\"I've been recommending this as long as I've been doing this work,\" said Samantha Gordon, deals editor for Consumer Reports. \"If you try to get it all done in one shot, you're not going to be able to take advantage of the deals because we do see back-to-school sales come and go throughout the season.\"\n\nPrioritize what your kid needs for the first few weeks of school, Patrick said.\n\n\"They don't need 30 pencils the first day of school. They don't need six glue sticks and all the things on the first day,\" Patrick said. Larger sales that happen after school resumes can help fill any gaps for items that were initially missed.\n\n\n\nResearch beforehand\n\nDoing some homework before shopping can help uncover lots of discounts for back-to-school items. Signing up for loyalty programs, looking on social media and being familiar with the prices of the items on your list are all ways to help reduce the cost.\n\nNatalie Kotlyar, who tracks retail as a principal at accounting and advisory firm BDO, encourages consumers to establish loyalty at their favorite retailers.\n\n\"Sometimes they get special discounts, special shopping windows, and then, of course, they earn points that they can cash in for dollars,\" Kotlyar said.\n\nLots of big retailers also offer specific student discounts, but some require signing up with a school email.\n\n\"Apple is a big one for that. They offer discounts on their laptops, on their cellphones. You can also find discounts on phone plans, on clothing and even online subscriptions like Amazon Prime,\" Gordon said.\n\nTake advantage of price matching \u2014 even after checkout\n\nIf you see a cheaper price on a store's website, most big retailers will honor it in person too. While policies vary, some retailers like Best Buy will also match a cheaper deal found at a competing store.\n\n\"That's been around for some time, and consumers don't really know about it or utilize it as much as they should,\" said Kotlyar.\n\nEven after checking out, monitoring the prices of the items you bought can help you save some money. Stores like Target offer retroactive price matching and will refund you the difference if an item you bought goes on sale within two weeks after purchasing.\n\n\"You can go to customer service and say, 'I just bought this, and now it's on sale. Can you refund me the difference?' And in most cases, they're set up to just say yes,\" said Gordon. \"Otherwise, what you can do is return the product and then buy it again for the cheaper value.\"\n\nConsider buying in bulk\n\nBuying in bulk, often at wholesale stores like Costco, Sam's Club and BJ's, can help save on the unit price of an item. For nonperishable items like pencils, stocking up can help save money long term, especially in households with multiple kids.\n\nEven for smaller families, Gordon suggests sharing bulk items to cut back on costs.\n\n\"If you have another family that you're close with, you can team up, split the cost of the membership, split the cost of the items too. You might not need 500 of one thing, but you might need 250, and then the other family can use the other half.\"\n\nExtra items can be used throughout the year or be saved for the following school year.",
