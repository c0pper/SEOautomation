                "text": "13:14\n\nPoland's Aleksandra Miros\u0142aw wins this first, historic Speed Climbing Olympic medal in the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. Silver goes to China's Lijuan Deng who was neck and neck with the Polish athlete right until the last moves. Polish teammate Aleksandra Kalucka secures bronze, while Rajiah Sallsabillah places fourth.\n\nWith the awarding of these first medals we'll now end our live reporting for today. We'll be back tomorrow at 10:00 with the Women's Lead Semifinal, followed by the Men's Speed Final at 12:35. We hope you enjoyed the spectacle, thanks for having been with us and see you tomorrow!\n\n12:59\n\nSPEED FINAL: Aleksandra Miros\u0142aw vs Lijuan Deng. Years of training for this moment. Deng gets off to an amazing start, but Miroslaw overtakes her, keeps it together, wins! Gold, the first historic Speed gold medal, goes to Aleksandra Miros\u0142aw.\n\n12:58\n\nSmall final: Aleksandra Kalucka vs Rajiah Sallsabillah. Kalucka sets off faster than lighting, Sallsabillah slips. Kalucka wins, tears of joy for her, bronze. The first Speed climbing \u200bmedal is hers!\n\n\n\n12:54\n\nA short break, then the small final for bronze. In many respects this is the cruelest comp of all. Aleksandra Kalucka vs Rajiah Sallsabillah. The winner takes an Olympic medal....\n\n\n\n12:52\n\nSecond semifinal: Rajiah Sallsabillah vs Lijuan Deng. Tension is sky high. Deng wins, 6.38 vs 6.41. They hug each other. What a race!\n\n\n\n12:49\n\nFirst semifinal: Aleksandra Miroslaw vs Aleksandra Kalucka. Teammates, but this is no training run... Miroslaw wins, but only just. She's in the final! And she's guaranteed a medal!\n\n\n\n12:45\n\nDesak Made Rita Kusuma Dewi vs Lijuan Deng. Dewi starts well but Deng overtakes her right at the end. Speed climbing at its finest, 6 milleseconds separate the two.\n\n\n\n12:41\n\nEmma Hunt vs Rajiah Sallsabillah. Hunt storms ahead, then slips. Sallsabillah wins, 6:54\n\n\n\n12:39\n\nAleksandra Kalucka vs Yafei Zhou. Kalucka wins 6:49.\n\n\n\n12:36\n\nAleksandra Miroslaw vs. Leslie Adriana Romero P\u00e9rez. Miroslaw wins with ease.\n\n\n\n12:35\n\n15m high. 5\u00b0 overhanging. 20 handholds. 11 footholds. 6.06 the world record. Those the stats. But the only thing that really counts is beating your opponent. The athletes are out, ready for the biggest competition of their lives!\n\n\n\n12:05\n\nAfter a short break, we'll be back at 12.30 for the women's speed. Their first-ever set of medals, awarded here in Paris in afew minutes time!\n\n\n\n11:58\n\nToday's Lead route was a tough test and despite the fact that no one managed to top out, the route setters did a great job of separating the athletes. The Semis proved exciting and the pressure was evidently intense. The top eight have qualified for the finals: Sorato Anraku (137), Toby Roberts (122.2), Adam Ondra (116.8), Alberto Gines Lopez (100.7), Jakob Schubert (98.8), Paul Jenft (91.1), Colin Duffy (87.9) and Hamish McArthur (79.3). They'll be back in the arena on Friday morning!\n\n\n\n1 1 JPN ANRAKU Sorato 69.0 (1) 68.0 (4) 137.0 Q 2 2 GBR ROBERTS Toby 54.1 (3) 68.1 (2) 122.2 Q 3 8 CZE ONDRA Adam 48.7 (5) 68.1 (2) 116.8 Q 4 13 ESP GINES LOPEZ Alberto 28.7 (14) 72.0 (1) 100.7 Q 5 3 AUT SCHUBERT Jakob 44.7 (6) 54.1 (6) 98.8 Q 6 12 FRA JENFT Paul 34.1 (9) 57.0 (5) 91.1 Q 7 6 USA DUFFY Colin 33.8 (11) 54.1 (6) 87.9 Q 8 18 GBR McARTHUR Hamish 34.2 (8) 45.1 (8) 79.3 Q 9 10 GER FLOHE Yannick 29.7 (12) 39.1 (9) 68.8 10 4 JPN NARASAKI Tomoa 54.4 (2) 12.1 (14) 66.5 11 9 FRA AVEZOU Sam 49.2 (4) 12.1 (14) 61.3 12 16 CHN PAN Yufei 29.0 (13) 30.1 (10) 59.1 13 7 GER MEGOS Alexander 24.7 (15) 24.0 (11) 48.7 14 15 BEL Van DUYSEN Hannes 34.3 (7) 12.0 (17) 46.3 15 5 KOR LEE Dohyun 34.0 (10) 12.0 (17) 46.0 16 17 SLO POTOCAR Luka 19.6 (17) 24.0 (11) 43.6 17 11 SUI LEHMANN Sascha 24.0 (16) 12.1 (14) 36.1 18 14 USA GRUPPER Jesse 18.9 (18) 12.0 (17) 30.9 19 19 AUS HARRISON Campbell 9.4 (19) 14.0 (13) 23.4 20 20 RSA JANSE van RENSBURG Mel 9.4 (19) 7.1 (20) 16.5\n\n11:52\n\nThere's no way Sorato Anraku can know it, but thanks to his excellent Boulder score the Japanese is mathematically in the final even before starting his lead run! The 19-year-old climbs confidently and quickly, without taking any risks whatsoever. He reaches the upper section but then, just like Ondra and Roberts, falls off the headwall moves that prove to intense and complex. Repeating his outstanding Boulder performance, he places first overall with a stunning 137 points.\n\n11:45\n\nToby Roberts is today's penultimate athlete and he's in strong contention for a medal! But the pressure and tension is the same for everyone. Right from the outset he climbs keeping everyone on tenterhooks, makes a couple of mistakes low down but miraculously stays glued to the wall. With his fingertips. After almost falling low down, he enters fight mode. Battles, recovers. Never gives up. And reaches the same hold as Adam Ondra before dropping off. 122.2 points, provisional first. And certainly in the final!\n\n11:34\n\nTomoa Narasaki, the first Japanese to compete today, knows he has to climb a bit outside his comfort zone if he wants a place in the finals. His risk-taking style isn't ideal for today's route and he ends his Olympics earlier than expected. His score of 66.5 won't be enough for the finals.\n\n\n\n11:30\n\nThe route is merciless, takes no prisoners. Even Dohyun Lee falls victim, low down, with a score of 46.0.\n\n\n\n11:25\n\nThe route continues to be unpredictable, nothing can be taken for granted, the athletes have shown us that it's possibile to fall literally anywhere. Colin Duffy tackles the route head-on, guns blazing, leaving nothing to chance. Halfway up he fumbles a clip. He continues, then falls. 87.9 his final score. Will it be enough to secure a ticket for the final? There are still 5 to go...\n\n11:20\n\nAlex Megos must now redeem himself after his poor performance in Boulder. He has a mountain ahead of him. He climbs confidently through the first section but suddenly his foot slips! Incredible! Unfortunately his race for an Olympic medal ends here, with a disappointingly low score of 48.7.\n\n11:14\n\nHere's an athlete we've all been waiting for, Adam Ondra, 3 times Lead World Champion, one one boulder, bronze at the Tokyo Olympics. He's gunning for gold. Banking on his incredible experience he seems to rest on every single hold, jams, takes weight off his hands. Completely soldi through the footless section, he's confident but not complacent. Now he's on the headwall, close to the highpoint set by Lopez, but then he fails to find the right body position and falls. Ondra being Ondra, he's not fully satisfied with his performance. But he also knows he's done enough to qualify for the final. He smiles and finishes the comp with 116.8 points, provisional first.\n\n\n\n11:09\n\nThe crowd goes into overdrive, Sam Avezou is out next! And the 7000 spectators continue to cheer him throughout the test! He climbs quickly, but perhaps a little too quickly, taking many risks. Too many? His foot slips and he falls, in absolute disbelief! He waves goodbye to the crowd, almost apologetically, with 61.3 points\n\n11:06\n\nYannick Floh\u00e9 tackles the route in control, climbing quickly and without problems low down. All of a sudden though he's in trouble. Completely. He falls and concludes his run with 68.7 points, too few for his Olympic dream!\n\n\n\n11:02\n\nSascha Lehmann out now, in his favourite discipline. However, he's not as cool and calm as usual, isn't efficient and falls low. Surprisingly, he finishes the comp with just 36.1 total points. His Olympic adventure ends here.\n\n10:56\n\nThe crowd erupts, cheers and chants to welcome Paul Jenft! The Frenchman climbs well, somehow finding excellent positions to rest in the overhanging section despite his unbelievable height of 1.90m. But too many risks on the traverse prove costly. He finishes the comp with 91.1 points though and is provisional second.\n\n10:50\n\nAfter an hour of competition, reigning Olympic Champion Alberto Gin\u00e9s L\u00f3pez, enters the stadium, wanting to redeem himself from a somewhat underpar boulder performance. He climbs far more relaxed than the rest of the field, perhaps feeding off his Tokyo experience. He's quick where he needs to be, takes a few calulated risks though the overhang, and suddenly is far higher than everyone else. Way higher. The route setters must be relieved. Then he falls on the headwall. 100.7 points in total put him into provisional first in the overall results. It is too early to say, but we'll hazard a guess: he's probably done enough for the final.\n\n\n\n10:45\n\nThe route is proving to be a extremely tough test for the athletes who have to fight pretty much right from the outset. Add to this the tension of being at the Olympics. But the top ten still need to climb. We can't wait to see what they'll get up to...\n\n\n\n10:42\n\nJesse Grupper begins by greeting the crowds with a huge smile! He climbs through the first part with determination but without haste. Up on the volumes he's suddenly in difficulty and falls low, way to low for his liking.\n\n\n\n10:38\n\nHannes Van Duysen sets off like a rocket he doesn't want to stay on the holds for a second longer than necessary. But halfway through the overhang he takes too much of a risk and falls. Way too low. He could have done much, much more.\n\n\n\n10:34\n\nPan Yufei enters the arena. He climbs a bit slowly, isn't as precise as usual, seems to struggle. The tension of the Olympic competition must be sky high. He falls and will no doubt be disappointed with his score of 30.1. Nevertheless he's in provisional third behind MacArthur. And Sorato Anraku, who hasn't climbed yet.\n\n\n\n10:30\n\nLuka Potocar is now out, ready to make up for a poor show in bouldering. Winner of the Lead World Cups, expectations are understandably high here. But he makes a few too many mistakes low down, he hesitates and falls low. He almost overly relaxed, definitely not his best showing today. 24 points.\n\n10:24\n\nThird athlete out is Hamish McArthur. The Brit seems slightly nervous but nevertheless climbs impressively. He controls the moves through the overhanging section leaving nothing to chance, but on the upper sections he wastes precious energy clipping a quickdraw. Despite this he goes full throttle and a few moves without feet he falls. 45.1 points. A great climb, probably not enough though.\n\n\n\n10:17\n\nNext up Campbell Harrison route in his favorite discipline. He'll certainly want to redeem himself after Monday's disappointing performance in Boulder. He climbs with determination and rhythm through the first section, comfortably through the traverse, but falls on the first volumes. What a great climb for the Australian who's done so much for climbing in general! 14 points.\n\n10:15\n\nThis Olympic semi-final begins with Mel Janse van Rensburg. He climbs through the first without hesitation, but as soon as he enters the steepest section the route changes gear and the South African tumbles. 7.1 his score.\n\n\n\n10:07\n\nAthletes are back in isolation. Mel Janse Van Rensburg will be the first out. The stadium is packed and ready to go!\n\n\n\n10:01\n\nThe comp has officially begun. 20 athletes are below the wall observing the route. They've got 5 minutes to check out the beta and it's great seeing that working out the moves together. Sportsmanship at its best. Better still, the Olympic spirit at its best!\n\n\n\n9:55\n\nAfter the sweltering heat on Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday is slightly cloudy. Temperatures should be lower, 17\u00b0C at the moment, but the action will be as blazingly hot!\n\n\n\n9:50\n\nLead is about to begin. Just a quick reminder about the Olympic scoring system which is significantly differentl from World Cup events. There are four scoring sections on the wall, and the higher they climb the more points they are awarded. Scores are assigned to each hold in descending order, starting from the top: the 10 highest holds, including the top, are worth four points each, followed by 10 holds that are worth three points each, 10 that are worth two points each, and 10 that are worth one point each. Any remaining hold before the start of the route has no point value. There will be signage on the wall to tell you the sections. An additional 0.1 points is awarded for using, but not controlling a hold.\n\n\n\n7:36\n\nWednesday 7 August, day 3 of sport climbing at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. Today the first, historic Speed \u200bmedals will be awarded. Yes because while at the Tokyo Olympics only 1 medal per gender was awarded to the Combined discipline that comprised Speed, Boulder & Lead, here in Paris the number of medals has been increased to 2 per gender: one for the Speed and one for the Combined Boulder+Lead.\n\nSo today all eyes will be on Speed starting at 12:30, in particular on immortal Aleksandra Miros\u0142aw who two days ago set a new world record by stopping the clock after 6.06 seconds. But first up there's the men's Lead, on that beautiful wall on the left side of the arena. 100 points are on the table and will be added to those already earned in Boulder two days ago. The best 8 qualify for the final. Sorato Anraku currently sits firmly in first place with 69 points, ahead of Tomoa Narasaki with 54.4 points and Toby Roberts with 54.1 points.\n\nJoin planetmountain for the latest sport climbing news from the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

On August 7, 2024, the search giant unveiled a dynamic animation celebrating the exhilarating sport of climbing, which is a key event at the Olympic Games. The doodle depicts a fleet of birds scaling a Parisian building, their tiny claws gripping the stone with remarkable agility. This playful yet powerful illustration perfectly encapsulated the spirit of the climbers as they conquered new heights.\n\nClimbing's Olympic Journey\n\nMaking its debut as an Olympic sport at the Tokyo 2021 Games, climbing rapidly gained a global following. The Paris Olympics further elevated its status, with a larger contingent of 68 athletes from around the world competing for medals.\n\nThe inclusion of Sports Climbing in the Tokyo 2021 Olympics was a historic moment for the sport, bringing it to a global audience and inspiring a new generation of climbers. The Paris 2024 Olympics will build on this success, with refinements to the format and increased visibility for the athletes.\n\nOne significant change for Paris 2024 is the separation of Speed Climbing into its own medal event, while Bouldering and Lead Climbing will be combined into a single competition. This adjustment allows climbers to specialize and focus on their strengths, promising even more intense and exciting competitions.\n\nThe Olympics website mentions: \u201cThe world\u2019s best 68 men\u2019s and women\u2019s sport climbing athletes will compete at the Olympic Games Paris 2024, from 5-10 August. This growing sport will now feature twice as many medal opportunities as Tokyo 2020, where sport climbing debuted on the Olympic programme. The two medal events now include speed, and bouldering and lead combined. Forty athletes will compete in boulder and lead, with 28 men and women competing in speed.\u201d",

[+] Paris on Aug. 6, 2024. Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\nThe speed discipline pulls out a single unique skill from the overarching event of sport climbing, which debuted at the Olympics in Tokyo. At the games in 2021, sport climbing was run as a single event that combined the three specialities of bouldering (climbing performed on short, technical routes without a rope), lead climbing (in which the climber clips a rope to protection points along the way) and speed (in which little other technicalities matter, other than quickness). For the Paris games, sport climbing was split into two separate opportunities to medal: in a combined event of bouldering and lead climbing, and in speed climbing. Speed climbers compete one-on-one to reach the top of a 15-meter wall as quickly as possible and the slower climbers are eliminated round by round in a bracket-style competition until one winner remains. Splitting the event into separate disciplines in Paris eased some criticism of the way sport climbing was run in Tokyo, where athletes said the various skills represent completely different specialities and feats of athleticism, and that forcing climbers to compete in a combined event resulted in an unfair \u201ccircus\u201d that did little to showcase technical prowess.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines.

He beat his own record of 4.79 seconds, which he set at a World Cup event in China earlier this year (it was matched by Veddriq Leonardo of Indonesia on Tuesday before Watson broke it). Watson next faces New Zealand\u2019s Julian David in the quarterfinals of the men\u2019s speed event Thursday.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nWith the new world record, Watson also has the title of the fastest time ever in a timed Olympic sport, according to CNN.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nThe final in women's speed sport climbing will be held at 6:54 a.m. EDT time Wednesday.

(Xinhua/Gao Jing)\n\nAleksandra Miroslaw of Poland clinched the first-ever Olympic gold in women's speed climbing at Paris 2024, narrowly defeating China's Deng Lijuan and setting a new world record.\n\nPARIS, Aug. 7 (Xinhua) -- Aleksandra Miroslaw of Poland bested China's Deng Lijuan in the big final to win sport climbing women's speed gold in this event's Olympic debut at Paris 2024 here on Wednesday.\n\nThe two-time world champion, fresh from setting a new world record of 6.06 seconds on Monday, clocked 6.10 to beat Zhou's personal best of 6.18.\n\n\"It means a lot. It's like the first time for the speed climbing and also for me here in the discipline, and I have my flag, and I was standing on the podium on the first place hearing the national anthem. It was amazing,\" said Miroslaw, who narrowly missed the podium in women's combined at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago when the sport was first introduced to the Olympic program.\n\nAsked how far she could go, the Pole replied with \"I don't know\". \"The sky is the limit I would say,\" she added.\n\nGold medalist Aleksandra Miroslaw of Poland poses with new work record, Aug. 7, 2024. (Xinhua/Gao Jing)\n\nDeng's silver is the first Olympic sport climbing medal for China, but she didn't appear to be overwhelmed by emotions.\n\n\"I think I haven't realized yet what I have achieved. I am bit at loss at the moment,\" said the 24-year-old. \"I think I'm a calm person, which is good for the sport.\"\n\nDeng said she was in a soundless world of her own despite the roaring crowds before the competitions.\n\nDeng edged reigning world champion Desak Made Rita Kusuma Dewi of Indonesia by a slim 0.006 seconds in the quarterfinals in the closest duel of the day, and had a solid performance to prevail in the semifinal clash against another Indonesian climber Rajiah Sallsabillah.\n\n\"I didn't think too much. I just focused on doing my best and concentrated on each climb without thinking about other things,\" said Deng.\n\nGold medalist Aleksandra Miroslaw (C) of Poland, silver medalist Deng Lijuan (L) of China and bronze medalist Aleksandra Kalucka of Poland communicate during the award ceremony, on Aug. 7, 2024. (Xinhua/Gao Jing)\n\nAnother Pole Aleksandra Kalucka (6.53) defeated Sallsabillah (8.24) in the small final to win the bronze.\n\n\"I was so happy and I couldn't believe that I just won (the) bronze medal. I'm super happy and proud of myself that I did it,\" said Kalucka.\n\nThe 22-year-old revealed that she texted her twin sister Natalie first after the match to share her joys. Natalie is also among the world's top sport climbers but missed the Olympics as each National Olympic Committee has only two quota places in the event.\n\n\"My sister is the most important person in my life. She gives me (everything) every day and I can truly say (that) without her, I wouldn't be here,\" she said.\n\nIn the lead competition of men's combined earlier on Wednesday, Alberto Gines Lopez of Spain led the field with 72 points and advanced into the Friday's final in the fourth place overall, while Sorato Anraku of Japan, fourth place in lead with 68 points, entered the final as top finisher overall. \u25a0",

                "text": "Paris Olympics 2024\n\n\"Will it be a surprise or will it be the favourite?\" intoned the master of ceremonies early on Wednesday afternoon at the Le Bourget Climbing Venue as top seed Aleksandra Miroslaw was limbering up on Wall A adjacent to the anointed outsider Lijuan Deng on Wall B.\n\nPoland's Aleksandra Miroslaw celebrates after winning in the women's sport climbing speed final during the Paris 2024 Olympic Games at Le Bourget Sport Climbing Venue in Le Bourget on 7 August, 2024.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nA matter of moments later, the 8,000 spectators gathered around the combat zone had their answer.\n\nMiroslaw had surged up the array of holds pinned into the 15-metre wall on a 5 percent incline in 6.10 seconds to claim the first Olympic speed title in women's sports climbing.\n\nDeng, the sixth seed from China, finished in 6.18 seconds.\n\nMiroslaw's fellow Pole, Aleksandra Kalucka, won the bronze following her scramble up the wall against Rajiah Sallsabillah from Indonesia. Those slug-a-beds offered up 6.53 and 8.24 seconds respectively.\n\nOn Monday, during the first round of qualification, 30-year-old Miroslaw set a world record of 6.06 seconds.\n\n\"I wasn't thinking about the time,\" said Miroslaw after her rapid ascent to gold.\n\n\"The one thing on my mind was just run ... whatever happens, just run. It means a lot, because the Paris Olympics is the first time for speed climbing and also the first gold for me.\n\n\"I have my flag and I was standing on the podium, hearing my national anthem. It was just amazing.\u201d\n\nSports climbing made its Olympic debut at the Tokyo Games in 2021 six years after its governing body, the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC), suggested the idea to the International Olympic Committee, the outfit which oversees the Olympic Games.\n\nDifference\n\nIn Tokyo, two sports climbing events were contested: men's combined and women's combined - a medley by any other name. It involved speed climbing, bouldering and lead climbing.\n\nIt was an amalgamation that did not sit well with the wider sports climbing community. Nor with a future Olympic champion.\n\n\"I'm really happy with this gold medal,\" added Miroslaw.\n\n\"I was also at the Tokyo Olympics and there was only the combined event so I've been happy that since Tokyo I have been able to focus on my specialty. It's really awesome.\"\n\nInsiders at the IFSC say that the federation had to take what was on offer to establish a foothold in the Olympic firmament.\n\nIn four years in Los Angeles, it is hoped that boulder or lead climbing might have their own medal events.\n\nChange\n\nFor Paris 2024, shorn of the speedsters, the combined medal in the men's and women events will incorporate lead climbing and bouldering which will take place on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.\n\n\"For me, the speed is totally different from the boulder and lead,\" said Miroslaw.\n\n\"I never have specialised in those so for me, it was a huge challenge to prepare for Tokyo.\"\n\nFor IFSC observers and local government bosses, the fans wending their way to and from the venue on the northern tip of Paris have vindicated the move to expand the sports climbing imprint on the Olympics and the decision to regenerate the area with improved tennis courts and football pitches as well as a new multi-sport gymnasium that boasts a sports climbing wall.\n\nOlympics windfall brings prospects of happy days to Paris suburbs\n\n\u201cThe Olympic Games has been the project that has made the regeneration happen,\" said Quentin Gesell, mayor of Dugny, a town next to Le Bourget. \"And it's something to be proud of.\"\n\nThe optics of the event blazed out too. Capacity crowd, searing sunshine, Abba's Mamma Mia booming out of the weapons-grade public address system, a happy, clappy spectacular.\n\n\"Of course, we all know that speed is something that can immediately be understood by the fans,\" said Fabrizio Rossini, communications director at the IFSC.\n\n\"It's fast and it's simple. We were struggling in Tokyo a little bit because we were forcing athletes to do different disciplines combined, which was not good for the speed and was not good for the athletes.\"\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe",

Unlike in speed climbing, where climbers memorize the route to the top, athletes are not able to see the bouldering routes prior to competition, which tests their problem-solving skills as much as their physical strength.\n\nBouldering does not use ropes, but mats with thick padding surround the boulder wall, which is just under 15 feet tall. The wall features four to five set routes, called \u201cproblems.\u201d",
