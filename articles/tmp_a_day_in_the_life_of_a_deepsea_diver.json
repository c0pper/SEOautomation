                "text": "Every year, on the 6th of August, International Scuba Diving Day is celebrated, inviting enthusiasts to plunge into the underwater world and explore. Scuba diving is a much sought-after underwater activity using apparatus like oxygen-filled tanks and breathing masks to comfortably breathe underwater and venture into the depths to see the mysterious and beautiful marine life up close. It\u2019s almost like another world, another planet, evoking a surreal feeling to witness a thriving ecosystem under the ocean, where humans cannot survive. Scuba dive and explore the mysterious underwater life (Unsplash)\n\nThe underwater life is a mystery as humans have explored only 5% of the inexplicable vastness. This International Scuba Diving Day, get a glimpse of this enigma and prepare to be awestruck, with a dash of existential musing, as you explore the ocean's depths. Here are some places to go scuba diving and have an unforgettable experience.\n\nGreat Barrier Reef\n\nGo scuba diving to watch live 'Finding Nemo.'(Pexels)\n\nLocated off the coast of Queensland, Australia, the Great Barrier Reef is the world\u2019s largest coral reef system. A hotspot of teeming marine life, the Great Barrier Reef spans over 2,300 km and consists of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands. The size is huge and is visible from outer space. It is the world\u2019s largest single structure made by living organisms. Dive for a brilliant view of the colorful corals under the stretch of blue. Many marine species like sea turtles, manta rays, reef sharks, and more are also spotted. The life and color underwater look mesmerising. It\u2019s considered one of the prime places for diving.\n\nALSO READ: Top must-visit destinations for readers to experience the magic of books in real life\n\nGreat Blue Hole\n\nA long time back a limestone cave submerged as water levels rose, to form today's Great Blue Hole.(Unsplash)\n\nA limestone cave that collapsed and a deep, cavernous chasm developed over time. Home to different shark species like bull sharks, nurse sharks, and Caribbean reef sharks, it may not be as rich in fish or coral life as the outside. However, what the Blue Hole lacks in marine life, it makes up with its geological wonder. This marine sinkhole in Belize promises an intriguing underwater experience with majestic stalactites, stalagmites, dripstone sheets, and columns at its core. It can be seen from space and is the second-largest barrier reef.\n\nGal\u00e1pagos Islands\n\nThe hidden gem that inspired Charles Darwin, the father of Evolution. (Pixabay)\n\nOff the coast of Ecuador lies the volcanic Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, a hidden gem tucked away from the world until introduced by Charles Darwin in his book \"On the Origin of Species.\" It\u2019s said to have inspired and influenced Charles Darwin vastly. Scuba diving in this once laboratory of evolution will be an unparalleled experience. Unique and rare wildlife like giant tortoises, hammerhead sharks, manta rays, marine iguanas, and blue-footed boobies can be spotted.\n\nALSO READ: Top 5 cultural festivals around the world you need to visit for a wholesome travel experience\n\nRaja Ampat\n\nRaja Ampat has four main islands Waigeo, Batanta, Salawati, and Misool. (Pixabay)\n\nThe Indonesian archipelago Raja Ampat, meaning \"Four Kings,\" inevitably beckons an interesting origin story for the name. Legend has it that Raja Ampat's four main islands emerged from magical eggs laid by an enchantress. This vast archipelago covers over nine million acres and features a mindblowing array of marine life, including over a thousand fish species and varieties of mollusks. Divers encounter schools of tuna fish, snappers, batfish, and barracuda.\n\nRed Sea\n\nCorals in the Red Sea are vivid. (Pexels)\n\nThe Red Sea makes you feel like you are flying in the sky as you float in the sea. With the perfect balmy temperature in Egypt, the Red Sea has more than 1,200 species of fish and 44 species of sharks. Apart from the frolicking underwater life, witness an ancient shipwreck, the SS Thistlegorm, a British steamship, now withering away at the sea bed. Or if you just want to relax, simply float in the water. The high saline content of the Red Sea makes it easier to float.\n\nALSO READ: Top natural phenomena that are a must for your travel bucket list",

                "text": "Awaken New Depths The ocean covers over 70% of the planet. It is our life source, supporting humanity\u2019s sustenance and that of every other organism on earth. The ocean produces at least 50% of the planet\u2019s oxygen, it is home to most of earth\u2019s biodiversity, and is the main source of protein for more than a billion people around the world. Not to mention, the ocean is key to our economy with an estimated 40 million people being employed by ocean-based industries by 2030. Even though all its benefits, the ocean is now in need of support. With 90% of big fish populations depleted, and 50% of coral reefs destroyed, we are taking more from the ocean than can be replenished. We need to work together to create a new balance with the ocean that no longer depletes its bounty but instead restores its vibrancy and brings it new life. \u201cAwaken New Depths\u201d is the theme for World Oceans Day 2024. The UN is joining forces with decision-makers, indigenous leaders, scientists, private sector executives, civil society, celebrities, and youth activists to\u00a0showcase how our relationship with the ocean needs to urgently change since our efforts to date have only skimmed the surface. To motivate widespread momentum for the ocean, we need to awaken new depths. Visit the official UN World Oceans Day website! Visit the official website to learn more about the International Day, find out about news and celebrations, or read the latest news and reports on the oceans. Join us and celebrate the value of oceans World Oceans Day reminds every one of the major role the oceans have in everyday life. They are the lungs of our Planet and a major source of food and medicine and a critical part of the biosphere. The purpose of the Day is to inform the public of the impact of human actions on the ocean, develop a worldwide movement of citizens for the ocean, and mobilize and unite the world\u2019s population on a project for the sustainable management of the world's oceans. This year, the United Nations will host a hybrid celebration\u00a0of the annual event on Friday 7 June 2024, hosted in-person at the UN Headquarters in New York to be broadcast live. It will highlight the 2024 theme of \"Awaken New Depths\". Hosted by the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea of the Office of Legal Affairs of the United Nations, in partnership with\u00a0the non-profit organization Oceanic Global, this year\u2019s annual event will shed light on how we can work together to ensure the ocean\u2019s health and well-being. \n Did you know? The ocean produces at least 50% of the planet\u2019s oxygen. The ocean is key to our economy with an estimated 40 million people being employed by ocean-based industries by 2030. Oceans absorb about 30% of carbon dioxide produced by humans, buffering the impacts of global warming.

                "text": "The impression given by Indonesia\u2019s biggest liveaboard operator of a smooth evacuation of the blazing Sea Safari VII on 2 May has been challenged by a British diver who was a guest onboard and, as a trained firefighter and SAR pilot, well-placed to judge how the incident played out.\n\nMike Day has worked as a search and rescue pilot for the past 10 years and, as a Royal Navy officer for 21 years, says he also conducted ship\u2019s firefighting and sea-survival training.\n\nThis included training as a firefighting and damage-control manager for his role as aviation officer in charge of 21 firefighters on an assault warship multi-aircraft flight deck. His knowledge of firefighting goes even deeper, because supplying marine fire-alarm and fire-suppression systems is the family business.\n\nDay has told Divernet that, based on what he witnessed when Sea Safari VII caught fire, the standard of firefighting equipment, command, leadership, training and competence among the boat\u2019s staff was \u201cextremely low to non-existent\u201d.\n\nFire on the Sea Safari VII (Mike Day)\n\nThe diver was on holiday in Indonesia with his partner. She had also undertaken sea-survival training.\n\nSea Safari VII had 14 double cabins, and the couple were among 14 divers staying at the Scuba Junkie Komodo resort who had been booked onto the liveaboard for a six-night Komodo National Park tour, accompanied by 14 Scuba Junkie dive-staff. The boat\u2019s own complement were estimated to number a further 14.\n\nThe liveaboard was the biggest of the five ironwood-hulled phinisi schooners run by Bali-based Sea Safari Cruises, which has been operating since 1989.\n\nThe phinisi schooner Sea Safari VII before the fire\n\nThe fire broke out near its base at Labuan Bajo on Flores, after the group had spent their first night on board and carried out an early-morning dive.\n\nSignificant black smoke\n\nThe operator\u2019s statement about the incident, as reported on Divernet on 4 May, revealed little more than that the vessel was \u201cengulfed in a fire\u201d and that \u201call guests and crew were safely evacuated\u201d. It had thanked both guests and crew for handling the emergency \u201cwith calmness and co-operation\u201d \u2013 but Day has now provided a more comprehensive account.\n\nHe was in the dining-room at around 8.30am following the dive when he says he heard panicked voices and saw \u201csignificant\u201d black smoke outside on the starboard side-ladder from the weather-deck.\n\nAs Day's partner spotted flames, he overheard one of the crew say \u2018Fire\u2019, but says that because neither the captain nor crew seemed to be taking any steps to raise the alarm he had followed his own training and shouted \u2018Fire!\u2019 loudly and repeatedly.\n\nThe couple started to make their way forward along the port-side weather-deck away from the smoke to the dive-deck, directing other divers in the group to go the same way. On their way, Day's partner located the life-jackets from the dining-room and handed them out to other guests.\n\n\u201cOn arrival at the dive-deck, the volume of smoke indicated to me that the vessel was already lost and we would have to abandon ship,\u201d says Day.\n\n\u201cUsing my judgment and experience and before conditions became too bad, my partner and I collected essential items from our cabin immediately adjacent to the dive-deck on the safer port side. The only guidance to do so was from me.\u201d\n\nNo formal roll-call was carried out by either the liveaboard or Scuba Junkie staff, says Day, and no form of alarm or call to an assembly point was heard, though Scuba Junkie staff and the liveaboard\u2019s cruise director can be seen on video footage calmly packing dive-gear close to where the guests were assembling.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion at this point both the Scuba Junkie guests and staff were passengers on a chartered vessel and under its care,\u201d says Day. \u201cNeither of us heard any instruction from the Scuba Junkie staff or the Sea Safari VII cruise director or staff for the entire duration of the incident.\u201d\n\nTaking to the life-rafts\n\nDay and his partner tried to reassure other passengers as well as liveaboard crew-members who, he says, \u201cwere terrified\u201d. Crew deployed two life-rafts on the upwind port side as three tenders, two from Sea Safari VII and one from elsewhere, stood by. Even as the smoke intensified and with flames visible, Day says that no formal order to abandon ship was ever given.\n\n\u201cOne of the Sea Safari VII crew shouted \u2018Jump!\u2019 and people started entering the water from the port rail,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was shouting in Indonesian, but not in English or any other language.\n\n\u201cWe witnessed the cruise director jump directly from Sea Safari VII into a life-raft. This is against all training, as it can damage the raft and cause injury. This was the person responsible for our safety, who hadn\u2019t spoken to us since commencement of the incident.\u201d\n\nDay's partner jumped into the water, climbed into the same life-raft and helped to pull others onboard. She told Day that the cruise director did not appear to be giving any instructions, so she had seen to it that people already onboard made space for others to get in.\n\n\u201cI entered the water, and remained outside the life-raft by the entry-ladder to assist other survivors in locating and boarding the raft,\u201d says Day. Then the raft\u2019s line was severed by Sea Safari VII, and it started to drift towards the liveaboard\u2019s by-now blazing stern.\n\nDay directed an approaching tender to take the cut line and tow the raft to safety. \u201cI had to order the tender crew to tie on the painter, as he was attempting to hold it in his hand and it was slipping away from him. Without my intervention it is undoubted that the life-raft would have entered the fire.\u201d\n\nView of the blazing Sea Safari VII from a life-raft (Mike Day)\n\nDay then stayed in the water by the ladder to co-ordinate people swimming towards the line, directing them to pull themselves towards the life-raft.\n\n\u201cI also had to order the people already in the raft to assist those in the water to board the raft including, lastly, myself.\n\n\u201cOnce on board the raft I saw that it was pointless to conduct a roll-call and watched to ensure that we remained clear of Sea Safari VII. My partner provided emotional support to the more distressed survivors.\u201d\n\nLeaving the scene (Mike Day)\n\nBack onshore\n\nAfter some five minutes the occupants of the life-raft were transferred to a Scuba Junkie dive day-boat. Another boat then approached and further crew and one other passenger also boarded the day-boat.\n\n\u201cOne crew-member with severe burns to the hands was transferred to a fast rescue vessel and we made our way from the scene to the Scuba Junkie resort,\u201d says Day, who had strained his back during the evacuation.\n\n\u201cSome offers of water were made by the day-boat crew, but my partner co-ordinated sharing water with the rest of the survivors. We provided our personal sunscreen \u2013 no offers were made from the crew.\u201d\n\nFrom the resort, the divers were taken on to the Laprima Hotel in Labuan Bajo. \u201cSea Safari Cruises devolved all responsibility,\u201d says Day. \u201cNo assistance, no compensation.\u201d\n\nHowever, he emphasised that Scuba Junkie \u201chas been brilliant with everyone. They care and they take safety very seriously but were let down by cost-cutting by Sea Safari. I will dive with Scuba Junkie again.\u201d\n\nThe diver says that at the initial onboard briefing a safety video had been shown, and the cruise director had asked all guests to fetch their life-jackets from their cabins to ensure that they fitted, although he and his partner had been the only ones to do so, and in the event the fit was not checked. There had been no briefing or tour of escape routes or nominated assembly points, according to Day.\n\n\u201cThe safety and well-being of our guests and crew are of paramount importance to us,\u201d stated Sea Safari Cruises following the fire. \u201cWe are taking every necessary step to investigate the incident thoroughly and to implement any measures required to prevent such occurrences in the future.\u201d\n\nDay says it had been noted by guests that the liveaboard\u2019s nitrox blending system was located in an encloed area, raising the possibility that pure oxygen could have been present inside an engine-room that appeared to have no fixed fire-suppression system.\n\nDivernet has put the criticisms raised by the divers\u2019 experience of the evacuation to Sea Safari Cruises, but it has yet to respond.\n\nThe fire is the third diving liveaboard blaze to occur in Indonesia in the past six months, following incidents involving Indo Siren in November and Oceanic in March, both in Raja Ampat.\n\nAlso on Divernet: Oceanic liveaboard catches fire in Indonesia, Survivors speak after fatal Red Sea dive-boat fire, Dive-boat blazed, whale shark grabbed in Thailand, Blaze consumes Indo Siren liveaboard",

Even with free DLC packs (including a Godzilla-based one), though, eventually a player\u2019s time with Dave the Diver must come to an end, and finding another game like it is no easy task.\n\nRelated 10 Great Story-Driven Indie Games Great Things Often Come In Small Packages\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that the list of \u201c2D-platformer deep-sea-diving restaurant-simulator RPGs with harpoon combat and farming systems\u201d is a short one. Nevertheless, for anybody finding themselves with a Dave-shaped hole in their heart looking to expand their horizons, here are some similarly-shaped games to help fill that void.\n\n10 Abzu\n\nFind Your Zen With Relaxing Scuba Diving\n\nDeveloper Giant Squid Metacritic Score 78\n\nIf the underwater settings of Dave the Diver were especially appealing to you, Abzu brings even more ocean exploration to the table. The game creates a relaxing and minimalist experience in the vein of titles such as Flower and Journey (several members of the original team behind Journey were actually on the development team for Abzu).\n\nA chill and peaceful indie game that anybody can pick up and enjoy, Abzu shares Dave the Diver\u2019s recognition of the beauty of scuba diving, as well as highlighting the importance of protecting the ecosystems of the ocean. Without spoiling anything, if you enjoyed the manatee-riding segments of Dave the Diver, then you\u2019ll probably love the majority of Abzu.\n\n9 Deep Rock Galactic\n\nA Chaotic Workplace Adventure With Friends\n\nDeveloper Ghost Ship Games Metacritic Score 85\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to experience the unusual work-life of a new bearded adventurer, look no further than Deep Rock Galactic. Up to four players can go on intergalactic dwarven mining expeditions in online co-op, where tons of chaotic hijinks and roguelite fun are around every corner.\n\nThe most fun thing about Deep Rock Galactic is its variety of movement-based mechanics, with rail-grinding, grappling hooks, and jetpacks all at the player\u2019s disposal. If you enjoyed the satisfying grinding and collectathon elements of Dave the Diver, or are just looking for a game that lets you drink mead and shoot monsters with your friends, Deep Rock Galactic is definitely worth checking out.\n\n8 Graveyard Keeper\n\nKeeping A Good Work-Death Balance\n\nDeveloper Lazy Bear Games Metacritic Score 69\n\nWhile obviously taking a darker approach to the \u201catypical job simulation\u201d formula, Graveyard Keeper shares Dave the Diver\u2019s light-hearted tone, attention to style, and chill atmosphere. A variety of tasks and responsibilities come with running a medieval-fantasy graveyard, not to mention the mysterious open world to explore.\n\nGraveyard Keeper will stand out to Dave the Diver fans thanks to its gorgeous pixel graphics and day-to-day life sim gameplay. If you find yourself getting tired of focusing on one kind of work, there are plenty of other paths to productivity and success to journey on in Graveyard Keeper (as long as you don\u2019t mind dealing with a corpse or two).\n\n7 SteamWorld Dig\n\nBecome A Robotic Prospector In The Wild West\n\nDeveloper Image & Form Metacritic Score 82\n\nDave the Diver fans who want a different 2D platformer/RPG with a fun grind should check out the steampunk-prospecting indie game SteamWorld Dig. This mining-based entry in the SteamWorld franchise features RPG elements in a different kind of dangerous workplace setting, with new gear and abilities to unlock as you go deeper and deeper into mine shafts of your own creation.\n\nRelated Goofy Games That Can't Help But Inspire a Chuckle or Two Helldivers 2 offers just as much comedy as it does solid, democracy-delivering gameplay, but it's not the only title out there with comic meat on it.\n\nIt\u2019s up to players to set up their own ladders, torches, and teleporters as pathways to the surface as they harvest more and more materials, and there are plenty of beasts to battle and secrets to uncover under the surface of the strange desert world you live on.\n\n6 Subnautica\n\nUnder The Sea Survival Crafting\n\nDeveloper Unknown Worlds Entertainment Metacritic Score 87\n\nThe deep sea diving genre has an ironically shallow pool of options to choose from, but players looking for more undersea exploration are advised to point their periscopes at Subnautica. The sci-fi survival crafting game takes place almost entirely underwater, as players must scavenge and adapt to survive the crash-landing of their starship.\n\nAn alien ocean full of new flora and fauna to discover awaits in Subnautica, as well as an array of new gadgets and upgrades to help survive the vast waters of this strange new planet. Fans of Dave the Diver craving another adventure beneath the waves of the ocean will be pleased by Subnautica\u2019s beautiful underwater graphics and three-dimensional diving gameplay.\n\n5 Final Profit: A Shop RPG\n\nFight Capitalism With More Capitalism\n\nDeveloper Brent Arnold Metacritic Score TBD\n\nThis charming indie title provides a familiar experience for Dave the Diver fans, as players source materials, explore new ventures, and invest in upgrades for their own independent business. Final Profit features an engaging story and a surprisingly expansive economy system, allowing players to manage their businesses while exploring a vibrant and magical world.\n\nIndie game fans will be enthralled by this self-published fantasy RPG from solo developer Brent Arnold, who not only designed and programmed the game but even composed the soundtrack. Final Profit is a hidden gem worth exploring for anyone looking to dive deeper into games with business management and RPG mechanics like those found in Dave the Diver.\n\n4 Stardew Valley\n\nA Cozy Farming Title You Can Play With Friends\n\nDeveloper ConcernedApe Metacritic Score 89\n\nJust like Dave the Diver, Stardew Valley combines farming, fishing, foraging, mining, and combat as key parts of running your local business, while also including life-sim RPG elements to keep you invested in your work. As relationships with your neighbors deepen, you\u2019ll find more new items, upgrades, and gameplay opportunities being offered to you.\n\nRelated 10 Games To Play If You Love Stardew Valley Stardew's nearly a decade old; it might be time for something new...\n\nStardew Valley achieves a cozy atmosphere that Dave the Diver fans are sure to appreciate, but also focuses on building, building creative farms, and time-based gameplay to create a unique but familiar experience. Expanding your farm, completing chores, maximizing profits, and decorating your town are all in a day\u2019s work for you and up to three friends in local or online co-op.\n\n3 Moonlighter\n\nDungeon Crawling And Shopkeeping Collide\n\nDeveloper Digital Sun Metacritic Score 81\n\nMoonlighter is a combination of roguelike hack-and-slash and shopkeeping simulator, with players running their store and restocking by plundering dangerous dungeons. As you upgrade your small town, as well as your own shop, new characters arrive to help you in your adventures and improve your gear.\n\nFinding the right balance in pricing your items for customers, performing maintenance while operating your business, and choosing the most productive and profitable inventory for the day are key elements in Moonlighter. Crucially, though, the choices you make inside your shop are only as good as the ones you make out in the field, where efficient dungeon crawling and surviving combat are necessary for success.\n\n2 Rolling Hills: Make Sushi, Make Friends\n\nBecome The World's Best Sushi-Making Robot\n\nDeveloper Catch & Release Metacritic Score TBD\n\nFor fans of the Diner Dash-style restaurant segments of Dave the Diver, enter Rolling Hills: a cute indie life sim in which you own, operate, and cook at your own sushi restaurant. This super-cozy title follows a robotic sushi chef who is tasked with taking over a small town\u2019s sushi restaurant, and the game comes with plenty of new neighbors to befriend and recipes to unlock.\n\nDave the Diver and Rolling Hills share a plethora of restaurant-management mechanics, with players working to earn cash, positive reviews, and new upgrades and decorations for their local sushi spot. If you\u2019re excited by the potential of a game in which sushi preparation meets Animal Crossing, Rolling Hills might be just what you\u2019re looking for.\n\n1 Dredge\n\nDeadliest Catch Meets H.P. Lovecraft\n\nDeveloper Black Salt Games Metacritic Score 80\n\nAt the top of the list is the only game to achieve its own licensed crossover into the universe of Dave the Diver: Dredge. In a coincidental twist of fate, both of these fishing/business-management/ocean exploration titles were released in 2023 to critical acclaim, leading to the announcement of the Dredge Content Pack for Dave the Diver at the 2024 Game Awards.\n\nDredge takes on a three-dimensional and creepier perspective, sure, but the player\u2019s goal in both games is the same: collect fish, sell fish, upgrade gear, repeat. With a cast of strange characters, new locations and secrets to uncover, and a nautical backdrop to an intriguing story, Dredge is easily the best choice for players looking for a new game to fill the void left by Dave the Diver.",

                "text": "THOOTHUKUDI: Unlawful practices adopted by conch divers in collecting fossilised chanks or conch shells from the seabeds off the Gulf of Mannar coast have caused fear among environmentalists, who state that the use of mechanical appliances, like compressors for breathing and jet compressor sprayers to comb the seafloor for dead chanks, could endanger the marine ecosystem.\n\nConch diving, an ancient pearl fishing-like activity that is widely practised in Thoothukudi coastal district, offers livelihood to at least 5,000 families residing in the Trespuram and Mettupatti areas of Thoothukudi town, and the collected chanks are of good demand in Kolkata. Chank fishing is carried out 10 to 12 nautical miles off the Thoothukudi coast in the territorial waters by divers with traditional knowledge to identify chank fishing grounds in the mid-sea. Usually, the chank season falls between September and February. The state fisheries department has issued over 165 licenses to collect chanks through skin diving methods (which involves diving deep into the waters by holding breath, and coming out quickly after collecting few conches), sources said.\n\nHowever, with the advancement of technology over the years, conch divers started using leg pads, goggles and compressors, dive deep into the sea at a depth of 30-40 feet, and comb the seabed with their padded legs. \"We dig trenches nearly four feet deep and 10 feet wide in the seabed, and often find only 15 to 20 conches a day,\" said a diver on conditions of anonymity. It may be noted that a single conch shell could fetch as much as Rs 1,000, depending on its whiteness and polish surface.\n\nSpeaking to TNIE, some conch divers opined that the use of modern equipment have enabled them to comb the seabed for longer intervals. \"Many divers can now stay underwater for nearly one-and-a-half hour with the aid of compressor hoses for breathing, while skin diving permits us not more than 90 seconds under water. However, it is not a healthy practice and has even led to increased mortality rates among young divers,\" they noted.\n\nFurthermore, divers have begun using jet compressor sprayers, which could blow out air at high pressures, smash soil cover and thereby disturb benthic organisms. It could also break coral reefs present in the ecologically significant Gulf of Mannar Marine Biosphere, sources said.\n\nConsidering the scenario, an activist told TNIE that the government must consider permitting scuba diving for chank collection, and sought a ban on the practice of digging seabeds using leg pads. \"Though skin diving need not be restricted as it is a traditional method, conch divers should not be allowed to dive with arms like rods and pads on legs,\" the activist added.\n\n\"The conch shells collected from the Gulf of Mannar are Indian sacred chank (Turbinella pyrum). The divers mainly exploit the seabed here, through destructive methods, in pursuit of fossilised Turbinella pyrum, also known as vellai sangu,\" stated a woman scientist of the Fisheries Research Institute. She added that the act disturbs the habitat of benthic organisms, small fishes, live conches, sea cucumbers and also collapses their food chain.\n\nMeanwhile, the Madurai bench of the Madras High Court had recently banned conch diving in the state. However, a final order is yet to be issued in this regard. Subsequently, conch divers appealed to the state government to regularise chank collection methods, allow safer practices using oxygen cylinders, instead of banning the age-old practice.\n\nLeaders of the Sangukuli Meenavar Sangam association told TNIE that no one resorts to skin diving nowadays, as it poses risks to their lives. \"All divers use compressors which enable them to do the activity fearlessly. Hence, the government must consider approving the use of advanced technologies in the conch diving industry, they added.\n\nFurther, Meerasa, a conch trader, said that conch diving was only a small business and caused no impact on marine ecosystems, in comparison to the damages inflicted by mechanised vessel fishing.\n\n",

The first essential item every diver should have is a well-fitting mask. A mask that fits properly ensures clear vision underwater and prevents leaks that can disrupt your dive. Additionally, a reliable regulator is a must-have to breathe comfortably while exploring the depths. Your regulator is your lifeline underwater, so make sure it's in top condition before every dive. Another key piece of gear is a buoyancy control device (BCD) that allows you to control your depth and stay buoyant throughout the dive. A properly fitting wetsuit or drysuit is essential for maintaining body temperature and protecting against the elements. Don't forget about fins, which help you move efficiently through the water and conserve energy. A dive computer is essential for tracking dive profiles, bottom time, and decompression limits. Lastly, always carry a surface signaling device, such as a whistle or inflatable surface marker, to alert boats or fellow divers in case of emergency. By having these essential items in your dive kit, you'll be well-prepared for a safe and enjoyable underwater adventure."

Become confident in your own diving skills and abilities, be ready to render aid to other divers, and to rescue yourself should that become necessary.

The first essential item every diver should have is a well-fitting mask. A mask that fits properly ensures clear vision underwater and prevents leaks that can disrupt your dive. Additionally, a reliable regulator is a must-have to breathe comfortably while exploring the depths. Your regulator is your lifeline underwater, so make sure it's in top condition before every dive. Another key piece of gear is a buoyancy control device (BCD) that allows you to control your depth and stay buoyant throughout the dive. A properly fitting wetsuit or drysuit is essential for maintaining body temperature and protecting against the elements. Don't forget about fins, which help you move efficiently through the water and conserve energy. A dive computer is essential for tracking dive profiles, bottom time, and decompression limits. Lastly, always carry a surface signaling device, such as a whistle or inflatable surface marker, to alert boats or fellow divers in case of emergency. By having these essential items in your dive kit, you'll be well-prepared for a safe and enjoyable underwater adventure."

Another key piece of gear is a buoyancy control device (BCD) that allows you to control your depth and stay buoyant throughout the dive. A properly fitting wetsuit or drysuit is essential for maintaining body temperature and protecting against the elements. Don't forget about fins, which help you move efficiently through the water and conserve energy. A dive computer is essential for tracking dive profiles, bottom time, and decompression limits. Lastly, always carry a surface signaling device, such as a whistle or inflatable surface marker, to alert boats or fellow divers in case of emergency.

The next challenge is to actually stick to the agreed course of action after you submerge. At its best, the buddy system is based on mutual trust and responsibility.",

Become confident in your own diving skills and abilities, be ready to render aid to other divers, and to rescue yourself should that become necessary. Tip: Especially as beginning divers, I recommend that husbands and wives not try to buddy together. Your marriage, and your diving, will be more enjoyable without that added stress.",

The first essential item every diver should have is a well-fitting mask. A mask that fits properly ensures clear vision underwater and prevents leaks that can disrupt your dive. Additionally, a reliable regulator is a must-have to breathe comfortably while exploring the depths. Your regulator is your lifeline underwater, so make sure it's in top condition before every dive. Another key piece of gear is a buoyancy control device (BCD) that allows you to control your depth and stay buoyant throughout the dive. A properly fitting wetsuit or drysuit is essential for maintaining body temperature and protecting against the elements. Don't forget about fins, which help you move efficiently through the water and conserve energy. A dive computer is essential for tracking dive profiles, bottom time, and decompression limits. Lastly, always carry a surface signaling device, such as a whistle or inflatable surface marker, to alert boats or fellow divers in case of emergency. By having these essential items in your dive kit, you'll be well-prepared for a safe and enjoyable underwater adventure."

Become confident in your own diving skills and abilities, be ready to render aid to other divers, and to rescue yourself should that become necessary.

The first essential item every diver should have is a well-fitting mask. A mask that fits properly ensures clear vision underwater and prevents leaks that can disrupt your dive. Additionally, a reliable regulator is a must-have to breathe comfortably while exploring the depths. Your regulator is your lifeline underwater, so make sure it's in top condition before every dive. Another key piece of gear is a buoyancy control device (BCD) that allows you to control your depth and stay buoyant throughout the dive. A properly fitting wetsuit or drysuit is essential for maintaining body temperature and protecting against the elements. Don't forget about fins, which help you move efficiently through the water and conserve energy. A dive computer is essential for tracking dive profiles, bottom time, and decompression limits. Lastly, always carry a surface signaling device, such as a whistle or inflatable surface marker, to alert boats or fellow divers in case of emergency. By having these essential items in your dive kit, you'll be well-prepared for a safe and enjoyable underwater adventure."

The good news is that hand signals allow divers to communicate efficiently during dives. Mastering them is one of the first skills student divers learn. Knowing these gestures thoroughly before submerging is crucial for safe and enjoyable dives.\n\nThe Importance of Learning Hand Signals\n\nHand signals are an essential skill that every diver must master before entering the water. They allow you to convey messages to your buddy when voice communication isn't possible, transcending language barriers and allowing divers from all over the world to understand each other. Learning them thoroughly ahead of time prevents confusion and dangerous situations underwater when you need to communicate quickly and effectively. Mastering them ensures you and your buddy have a shared understanding, even if you've never dived together before.\n\nDo's and Don'ts",
