They are one of the most prolific meteor showers of the year, providing skywatchers with ample opportunities to catch a glimpse of a shooting star during the warmer summer nights.\n\nEvery year, Earth passes through the path of Comet Swift-Tuttle.

(Image credit: Future)\n\nThe meteor shower is caused by debris left behind by comet Swift-Tuttle , the largest object known to repeatedly pass by Earth . It last swung by our planet in 1992 and won't return until 2126. As Earth passes through the comet debris, fragments of rock and ice enter Earth's atmosphere at speeds of up to 130,000 mph (209,000 kph), about 85 times the top speed of a jet fighter. These speeds cause the air in front of the debris to compress and heat up to thousands of degrees. This results in the dazzling trails of bright light known as meteors, or \"shooting stars\".\n\nMeteor showers are named after the constellation from which the meteors appear to radiate from. From Earth's perspective, the Perseids appear from approximately the direction of the Northern Hemisphere constellation Perseus .\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

                "text": "The Perseid meteor shower will peak Sunday night, giving astronomy fans one of the best shows of 2024 as they look to the skies.\n\nThe shower started in July and will continue through most of August, but it will peak overnight on Sunday into Monday, NASA said. The Perseids are considered the \"best meteor shower of the year\" by NASA, with about 50 to 100 meteors seen per hour under ideal conditions.\n\nWhat time will the Perseid meteor shower peak tonight?\n\nThe best time to catch the Perseids is in the pre-dawn hours, according to NASA, but it is possible to view meteors from this shower as early as 10 p.m.\n\nNASA notes that the Moon will set right as the Perseids start to peak. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonset times for different ZIP codes across the United States.\n\nWhere will the Perseid meteor shower be visible?\n\nThe best view of the Perseids meteor shower will be in the Northern Hemisphere. NASA urges astronomy fans who want to check out the shower to get away from the bright lights of cities.\n\nView of meteorite streaking over Trona Pinnacles near Death Valley, CA during annual Perseid Meteor Showers, Aug. 2, 2019. Bob Riha Jr / Getty Images\n\n\"Try to get to the darkest location you can,\" NASA wrote. \"The darker it is where you are, the more meteors you will see streaking across the sky.\"\n\nAround 50 to 75 meteors may be seen an hour in darker locations.\n\nWhat direction should you look for the meteor shower?\n\nLook up! NASA suggests lying on your back, allowing your eyes to adjust to the dark and staying off your phone. There's no need to look in any particular direction as the meteors can generally be seen all over the sky.\n\nThe space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said it can be helpful to face roughly northeast as you lie down, but viewers should try to take in as much of the sky as possible because meteors can appear all over.\n\nWhen will the next meteor shower be?\n\nTwo other meteor showers are actually active right now. The Southern Delta Aquariid meteor shower began last month and will run through Aug. 21. It peaked in late July. The alpha Capricornids, a small meteor shower, also started last month. It will continue through Aug. 11, according to the American Meteor Society.\n\nThe next major meteor shower, the Orionids, won't be active until late September, with a peak in October, according to the American Meteor Society. NASA describes the Orionids as one of the most beautiful showers of the year. The Orionids are known for their brightness and speed.\n\nWhat are meteor showers?\n\nMeteors \u2014 space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere \u2014 streak through the sky every night, but meteor showers happen less frequently. During a meteor shower, many meteors hit Earth's atmosphere over a short period of time. When they pass through the atmosphere, the meteors leave behind streaks of light caused by glowing, hot air.\n\nView of meteorite streaking over Trona Pinnacles near Death Valley, CA during annual Perseid Meteor Showers, Aug. 2, 2019. Bob Riha Jr / Getty Images\n\nWhile most meteors burn up as they fall, some survive the trip and reach Earth. Those surviving space rocks are considered meteorites.\n\nLook up \u2014 what else can you see in the sky this summer?\n\nThere are two more full moons this summer. August's full moon, known as the Sturgeon Moon, reaches peak illumination on Monday, Aug. 19. September's full moon will reach peak illumination on Tuesday, Sept. 17, just days before the start of fall.",

                "text": "Skygazers haven't lacked reasons to go outside and marvel at the sky this year, from solar eclipses to multiple instances of aurora borealis. The show is far from over, with a planet parade happening in late August and a once-in-a-lifetime nova explosion that could happen any day now. While you wait for those, the Perseids meteor shower is approaching its peak.\n\nPerseids is one of the most popular and consistent celestial events to grace the nighttime skies, taking its name because the meteors appear from the general direction of the constellation Perseus. The meteors are produced by the Swift-Tuttle comet as Earth passes through the comet's tail, burning up the various chunks of ice and rock in the atmosphere as it does so.\n\nThis year, the meteor shower started on July 14 and will continue through Sept. 1, though it tends to peak around the same three day span every year. It'll peak somewhere between Aug. 11 and Aug. 13.\n\nRead more: Here's How to See 6 Planets in the Sky at Once in the Upcoming Planet Parade\n\nMeteoric activity will be more or less random until the shower peaks. Once the peak happens, the sky will light up with anywhere from 50 to 75 meteors per hour according to the American Meteor Society -- although NASA predicts that it could be up to 100 meteors per hour. The meteors, which are at first called meteoroids, travel at over 130,000 mph when they hit the Earth's atmosphere, which is when the name changes to meteor.\n\nPerseids has already made an appearance in at least one meteor shower event this year. The Southern Delta Aquariids and Alpha Capricornids had their meteor shower peaks at the end of July and since Perseids is active during that time, it joined in to form a rare triple meteor shower. With both of those other meteor showers finishing up on Aug. 21 and Aug. 15, respectively, it's not unlikely that one of the meteors you see during Perseids is actually from one of the other two meteor showers.\n\nA meteor streaks across the sky during the 2023 Perseid meteor shower. VCG/Getty Images\n\nBest time to see the Perseids meteor shower?\n\n\n\nPredictions on the best day vary. Space.com says Aug. 11 is the best night, NASA says Aug. 13, EarthSky says Aug. 12 and the American Meteor Society says the evening of Aug. 11 into Aug. 12 is the best time to see the meteor shower. So, we'll split the difference here and recommend checking it out on all three nights. It should be a pretty good show regardless of which evening you choose.\n\nIf you want the best chance to see a lot of meteors, between midnight and 5 a.m. is the best time. That is when it'll be the darkest. For most of the northern hemisphere, the moon should also set sometime between midnight and 1:30 a.m., so you won't have it drowning out the meteors with its own light.\n\nWhere is Perseids visible?\n\nThe majority of planet Earth will be able to witness the Perseids event. That includes the entire northern hemisphere and the northern half of the southern hemisphere. Any further south and you may run into some issues.\n\nIn short, anywhere where the constellation Perseus is visible in the night sky will be able to see the Perseids meteor shower.\n\nIf you're wondering where that'll be in the night sky where you are, a good tool to try is Time and Date. Enter your location and the date. After that, use the tool's slider to change the time to around midnight or 1 a.m. and then scan around the sky for Perseus. Then simply look in that direction on the prescribed dates. For example, in central Ohio, Perseus will be along the horizon in the northeastern part of the sky.\n\nRead more: Don't Miss Seeing a Once-in-a-Lifetime Cosmic Explosion From Your Own Backyard\n\nSky Tonight (Android, iOS) is another good mobile app for this purpose. Enter your location and fast forward to Aug. 11-13. From there, find Perseus in the sky and note the direction and how close it is to the horizon. Look in that direction on the given nights to see meteors.\n\nWill I need any special tools to see Perseids?\n\nNo. The meteor shower is bright enough and consistent enough that you should be able to see it with the naked eye when gazing upon the night sky. Binoculars can help, but telescope users run the risk of missing meteors due to being focused on too small a patch in the sky. Those looking to take pictures of the event will be able to see the meteors just fine with a smartphone camera or a more professional camera.\n\nFollow the standard rules for looking at things in the night sky. You'll want to get as far away from light pollution as possible and, of course, the weather will be a factor as well. The moon shouldn't be an issue as the American Meteor Society says that the moon should be either low or below the horizon by the time the cosmic fireworks start.\n\nTime Magazine estimates that suburbanites will see approximately 10 per hour if they're lucky while people in the big cities may not see any at all. So, the closer to the city you are, the better an idea it is to take a drive out of town to see the shower.\n\nWhat causes the Perseids meteor shower?\n\nThe Swift-Tuttle comet orbits around the sun once every 48,700 days, which translates to 133\u2153 years. The comet is one of the larger ones in our solar system with a radius of 16 miles, which NASA says is nearly twice the estimated size of the object that allegedly killed the dinosaurs.\n\nAs the comet orbits the sun, it leaves behind a tail of dust, ice and debris. About once a year, Earth's orbit goes right through that tail, blazing a trail through the comet's debris. The pieces of debris that wind up burning up in the Earth's atmosphere are called meteors, and the debris field Earth flies through is referred to as Perseids.\n\nThe American Meteor Society has a neat graphic that shows how it all works. Swift-Tuttle has a massive debris field that it consistently flies through and Earth's orbit takes us right through at around the same time every year like clockwork.",

Skywatchers across the UK will be among those able to enjoy the Perseid meteor shower, which takes place when the Earth ploughs through debris left behind by the Swift-Tuttle Comet during its trips through the inner solar system\n\nIf skies are clear, the Perseid meteor shower should be visible across the UK from around midnight tonight until the early hours of August 13\n\nIf skies are clear, the Perseid meteor shower should be visible across the UK from around midnight tonight until the early hours of August 13.\n\nThe event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swift-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every 133 years.\n\nThe meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earth's atmosphere at 36 miles per second, to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.\n\nPeak temperatures can reach anywhere from 1,648\u00b0C to 5,537\u00b0C as they hit the atmosphere.\n\nThe meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.\n\nAlthough they officially peak on the night of August 12, Daniel Brown, associate professor in astronomy at Nottingham Trent University, said it is worth keeping an eye out for a secondary peak, should it occur.\n\nHe said: 'The meteor shower slowly builds up from mid July to then reach its peak activity at 100 per hour on August 12.\n\nAlthough they officially peak on the night of August 12, Daniel Brown, associate professor in astronomy at Nottingham Trent University, said it is worth keeping an eye out for a secondary peak, should it occur\n\n'It then reduces until the mid-end of August.\n\n'However, in reality, the activity can show more complex variation which means the peak might not be the only one.\n\n'The years 2018 and 2020 had some increased activity a day or two after the main peak.\n\n'So in addition to meteor showers not being a one-evening thing \u2013 slowly increasing and then decreasing over days \u2013 we might see that the most active evening might be followed by another one a day or two later.'\n\nTo make the most of the meteors, experts say observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find unobstructed views.\n\nProf Brown said: 'Best time this year during the main peak is the second half of the night, that is the early hours of August 13. Find a place that is dark, away from direct light.'\n\nHe said it will take viewers up to 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness.\n\nProf Brown said: 'Bring along patience, and it is best to observe a big range of the sky as meteors will be visible all over.'",

Here's what you need to know... During a meteor shower, fireballs appear to streak across the sky\n\nThis happens because pieces of debris are rapidly burning up as they eneter Earth\u2019s atmosphere\n\nThat debris is often left behind by a collision between two space objects, like a planet or comet\n\nThe Orionids shower is debris from Halley\u2019s Comet, a huge chunk of ice orbiting the Sun\n\nMany meteor showers are repeated\n\nThey occur at a height of around 62 miles\n\n3 Stargazers should head to a location well away the city lights, the glow of a town, and even that of street lamps Credit: Getty\n\nHow to watch\n\nThe best time to catch a glimpse of the display will be between midnight and 5:30am - when the sky is darkest.\n\nIt might be harder to spot them during the longer summer nights.\n\nHere are four tips to give yourself the best chance of seeing them:\n\nAvoid light pollution\n\nStargazers should head to a location well away the city lights, the glow of a town, and even that of street lamps.\n\n\"This could mean heading out to the countryside, a nearby park or even do something as simple as turning your back to street lamps if you are not able to go anywhere,\" the Royal Greenwich Observatory advises.\n\nHD 189733 b: One of the 'Most Terrifying' Planets in Our Galaxy\n\nPut the phone away\n\nYou should give your eyes at least 15 minutes to adjust to the dark so you can see the fainter meteors.\n\nThis means you need to put that phone screen down.\n\nMeteors can appear in any part of the sky so the more sky you can see the better Royal Greenwich Observatory\n\nUnobstructed view\n\nMake sure that your star gazing spot has an unobstructed view of the horizon and above.\n\nAway from treelines or cityscapes is best.\n\n\"Meteors can appear in any part of the sky so the more sky you can see the better,\" the Observatory adds.\n\nChoose binoculars wisely\n\nBinoculars might not always be needed - or helpful.\n\nThey can limit your view of the sky, and in trying to get a more detailed look, you could miss shooting stars out of frame.",

[+] Images) Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\nThe aurora borealis forecast for Saturday night has a Kp index of five, meaning the lights are expected to become brighter and provide a visible viewing experience for those \u201cin the right place,\u201d according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA stated in a weekend space weather forecast that solar material which erupted from some overactive sunspots are expected to be visible early Saturday morning and Sunday night. A geomagnetic storm watch is in place until Sunday and noted the aurora could be visible over northern states. Observers could get a glimpse at the northern lights alongside the Perseid meteor shower\u2014a highly active meteor event expected to peak between Sunday night and Monday morning.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines.

NOAA\n\nHow Do You See The Lights?\n\nLights are usually most active between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. and can be better seen in areas with little to no cloud cover and minimal light pollution.\n\nHow Do You Photograph The Lights?\n\nSmartphones should be turned on to night mode to change exposure time, which could show the lights\u2019 movement depending on how long the time is set for, according to Visit Iceland.\n\nTangent\n\nAnchorage, Alaska, has a high chance of seeing the lights on both nights, according to NOAA, which notes an aurora does not need to be directly overhead for observers and can be seen from as far away as 621 miles if the lights are bright and conditions are ideal.\n\nKey Background\n\n2024 has marked a strong year for solar activity and coincided with the sun\u2019s 11-year solar cycle approaching a peak forecasted for late this year and early 2026. Projections from NOAA anticipate a peak including 115 sunspots\u2014where geomagnetic storms come from before they generate auroras. Meanwhile, the Perseid meteor shower\u2019s peak is expected to generate more than 50 meteors per hour. Astronomers warn the meteors can be faint to the naked eye and have advised observers to put their phones away and avoid light pollution, as it can take the eyes up to 30 minutes to fully acclimate to night visibility.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nPerseid Meteor Shower: Why Astronomers Recommend Putting Your Phone Away For This Weekend\u2019s Show (Forbes)",

In addition to clear skies with few clouds, you need to set yourself up in a spot with minimal light pollution, as city lights can obscure all but the most powerful meteors.\n\nTo help you find those dark skies, and make the most of the year\u2019s grandest meteor shower, I\u2019ve picked seven of the best national parks for Perseids peeping, including many I\u2019ve stargazed from myself.

But rest assured, the professor adds, \u201cthe Perseids are famous for producing some very bright meteors that are visible from even non-ideal locations, so wherever you are you\u2019ll probably be rewarded for looking up for a bit near the shower\u2019s peak.\u201d",

The Perseid meteor shower is one of those celestial events you don\u2019t want to miss. Seriously!\n\nThe summer months are often disturbed by daytime thunderstorm activity; the remaining clouds often extend into the nighttime hours. But weather patterns are changing, so we might get lucky and see stable weather with low cloud coverage and thunderstorm activity around the peak.\n\nPerseid meteor shower this year is expected to produce around 100-120 meteors per hour during both nights around the peak this year, on August 12th and 13th. The Perseid\u2019s main peak occurs around August 12th, 14 UTC.\n\nThis is almost as perfect as it gets for Western Europe, the United States, and Canada during August 11/12th and 12/13th nights.",
