By utilising resale websites such as viagogo and Stubhub, you can still buy your ideal ticket right now.\n\nHere\'s the breakdown:\n\nHow to buy Pearl Jam resale tickets now\n\nPearl Jam tickets are available right now on various resale websites. Below, we have listed viagogo, Vivid Seats and Stubhub as options for fans to get their fix right now. Here\'s the links:\n\nviagogo and resale tickets Sites such as Viagogo and Vivid Seats allow fans to buy resale tickets from other fans. However, it is important to note that many event promoters say tickets should not be resold after initial purchase and will not be valid for admittance to gigs. Fans attending live events with tickets acquired through resale websites are advised to double check the ticket terms and conditions at the point of sale - such as Ticketmaster or Live Nation - to ensure a smooth live event experience. Tickets could be voided if they were found to be bought second-hand. As a result, fans are buying at their own risk. With that said, viagogo also commented: "viagogo is a regulated marketplace where fans have the guarantee."\n\nWhile these tickets may be priced a little higher than some face-value tickets (with some beginning at £102), they will allow fans to purchase their ideal entry. This means you could secure anything from front-standing to back-row seating.\n\nOtherwise, fans are encouraged to also try their luck on official retailers once again, such as Ticketmaster and Live Nation. While the selection may be smaller, fans might grab a last-minute deal.

The new one (‘Dark Matter’) goes even harder.”- Associated Press\n\n“(Dark Matter)…tailor-made for chanting and fist-pumping.” – SPIN\n\nPearl Jam will release their twelfth studio album, Dark Matter, on Monkeywrench Records/Republic Records on April 19, 2024 and launch a 35-date worldwide tour this May. The album’s title track is available now HERE. Produced by multi-GRAMMY® award winning producer Andrew Watt, Dark Matter, marks the band’s first release since critically-acclaimed Gigaton (2020).\n\nDark Matter is now available for pre-order HERE.\n\nIn 2023, the members of Pearl Jam—Eddie Vedder [vocals], Jeff Ament [bass], Stone Gossard [rhythm guitar], Mike McCready [lead guitar], and Matt Cameron [drums]—retreated to Shangri-La Studios in Malibu where they simply plugged in and played with producer Andrew Watt at the helm.\n\nThe musicians faced one another in the same space and communicated sonically at the highest level. Writing and recording in a burst of inspiration, Dark Matter was born in just three weeks.\n\nAs a result, Dark Matter channels the shared spirit of a group of lifelong creative confidants and brothers in one room playing as if their very lives depended on it. All of the blood, sweat, tears, and energy of a storied career felt renewed and poured into this one body of work.\n\nThe band members personally previewed the record with a listening party at the iconic Troubadour in West Hollywood during GRAMMY® week:\n\nVedder said: “I’m getting chills, because I have good memories. We’re still looking for ways to communicate. We’re at this time in our lives when you could do it or you could not do it, but we still care about putting something out there that is meaningful and we hopefully think is our best work. No hyperbole, I think this is our best work.”\n\nAment added, “What Ed said about getting us in a room at this point, we felt like we were about to make a really important record. A lot of that had to do with the atmosphere Andrew set up. He has encyclopedic knowledge of our history, not only as a band and how we wrote songs, but as players. He could pinpoint things we did on old songs to the point where I was like, ‘What the fuck is he talking about?’ His excitement was contagious. He’s a force. I just want to say thanks for keeping us on track. I couldn’t be prouder of us as a band. I feel so grateful for the fans, but mostly for my brothers and these people I’ve made music with.”\n\nThe band is celebrating indie record stores with the release of a special edition of Dark Matter on April 20. Only at participating stores as part of Record Store Day. Get more information and find stores at www.recordstoreday.com\n\nDark Matter album packaging features light painting art by Alexandr Gnezdilov. Light painting is an artistic form of photography where images are created by adjusting a camera’s exposure for an extended period and using a light source, such as a flashlight, to “paint” in the dark. The album cover art was crafted using a large self-made kaleidoscope. Each letter visible on the cover was individually captured and handwritten midair with a specially designed flashlight to create the pearlescent effect.

The band’s lineup consists of bassist Jeff Ament, rhythm guitarist Stone Gossard, lead guitarist Mike McCready, lead singer/guitarist Eddie Vedder and drummer Matt Cameron. Thirty plus years of live performances, twelve studio albums and hundreds of official live concert bootleg releases later, Pearl Jam continues to be critically acclaimed and commercially successful. The band has sold over 85 million albums worldwide and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nSince the earliest days, Pearl Jam has used its platform to elevate people and causes that often go unnoticed or underserved. Much of the band’s philanthropic work is accomplished through its Vitalogy Foundation which to date has raised more than $50 million for organizations supporting issues such as abortion access, climate change and homelessness, and drawing attention to the fight against diseases such as Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis and epidermolysis bullosa (EB). In addition to the money Vitalogy donates, the band also donates signed instruments, posters and merchandise to organizations to use for their own fundraising purposes. Compounding the impact of Vitalogy Foundation, the band has supported Jeff Ament’s Montana Pool Service building skate parks in Montana and South Dakota. Pearl Jam also lends its voice to notable causes like the West Memphis 3, voting rights and fair ticketing practices. Over the past three decades, the band has a long history of standing up for what it believes in and putting its resources behind those beliefs.\n\nThrough its innovative Ten Club and fan engagement, community building, coveted poster designs, and longstanding activism and philanthropy, Pearl Jam continues to have a lasting impact on generations of music lovers.\n\nAbout Andrew Watt\n\nThe name Andrew Watt in recent years has become synonymous with one very true phrase: the music industry’s not-so-secret weapon. Since 2015, the multi-GRAMMY-winning and platinum-selling music producer has been a hit-making machine, having collaborated with some of the last decade’s most exciting, and ground-breaking artists, including including Justin Bieber, Ozzy Osbourne, Cardi B., Post Malone, Dua Lipa, Metallica, Stevie Wonder, Miley Cyrus, Bruno Mars, Shawn Mendes, Elton John, Lana Del Rey, Mick Jagger, Brandi Carlile, Paul McCartney, Smokey Robinson and Lady Gaga, to name a few.\n\nIn 2021, Watt took home his first GRAMMY Award for “Producer of the Year” at the 63rd annual GRAMMY Awards for his work on Ozzy Osbourne’s Ordinary Man, Miley Cyrus’ Plastic Hearts, both of which he executive-produced, Dua Lipa’s Future Nostalgia, which took home the GRAMMY that year for Best Pop Vocal Album, and Post Malone’s Hollywood’s Bleeding, which was nominated for Album of the Year. The following year saw Watt produce the widely publicized and critically acclaimed Elton John and Britney Spears collaboration “Hold Me Closer,” the entirety of Eddie Vedder’s solo release Earthling, and Ozzy Osbourne’s GRAMMY Award winning Patient Number 9, which earned Watt his second GRAMMY win for “Best Metal Album” at the 65th GRAMMY Awards. 2023 was also a stellar year for Watt, kicking off the top of the year with the release of Iggy Pop’s long-awaited 19th studio album, Every Loser, released via an exclusive partnership between Atlantic Records and Watt’s own Gold Tooth Records. This past summer also saw a slew of high profile and record-breaking releases on which Watt is credited as co-writer and co-producer, including; The Kid LAROI’s single “Forever and Again” which was released as part of the Barbiemovie soundtrack, and Jungkook’s “Seven,” which debuted at #1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart and amassed a record-breaking 217.1 million streams and 269,000 downloads in just its first week of release. Watt ended the year with the release of “Hackney Diamonds,” The Rolling Stones’ first album of original music in 18 years, which was fully produced by Watt. The album’s lead single “Angry” earned Watt a GRAMMY Nomination for “Best Rock Song” for his work co-writing and producing the track.\n\nAbout Alexandr Gnezdilov\n\nAlexandr Gnezdilov created the light photography art for the cover of Pearl Jam’s Dark Matter single and album along with the featured lettering. His work is also utilized throughout the Dark Matter campaign. His interest in photography began at an early age in Moldova where he spent his childhood before expanding to explore long exposure and light painting techniques after moving to Germany in 2001.\n\nAlexandr created the cover of Dark Matter using a large self made kaleidoscope with each letter visible on the cover individually captured, handwritten midair with a specially designed flashlight to create the pearlescent effect. His artwork has been featured in multiple exhibitions including collaborations with the State Theatre of Nuremberg and has been licensed for the past decade for articles, news and commercials.\n\nGnezdilov lives in Nuremberg, Germany with his wife and two sons and works primarily as a software engineer.

The band, performing shows in England and Europe for its ongoing Dark Matter World Tour this summer, have reportedly dropped some tickets by more than 50 percent from the initial ask.\n\n“Premium standing” tickets for shows at London’s Tottenham Hotspur grounds were being sold at £249.45, while even seats at the back of the stadium were £125. Now, tickets are available for £49.20, with more than 10,000 apparently remaining up for grabs as of Wednesday afternoon.\n\nPearl Jam are the latest of many acts to have to shift plans or prices amid soft demand so far in 2024. While promoters and artists have rode a wave of post-COVID demand to record-shattering profits driven by ever-spiraling ticket prices, that trend seems to have fallen apart for many tours this year.\n\nThe Black Keys famously saw their tour cancelled entirely after fans rejected the idea of paying the outrageous ticket prices being asked, which led to the band splitting with mega-manager Irving Azoff. Jennifer Lopez first shifted her tour plans to be a “greatest hits” feature before cancelling the run entirely, and many other artists are seeing widespread complaints about pricing schemes and postponing individual shows for various reasons that many believe are actually due to poor sales.\n\n| READ MORE “We Got F**ked,” in Tour Debacle, says Black Keys Drummer |\n\nRather than cancel, Pearl Jam has opted to slash prices in hopes of filling seats. And while that may benefit some fans who held off on purchasing, many fans have expressed outrage over the decision, since so many of the band’s biggest supporters purchased during the initial sales period when the “face value” price was so high, not to mention the use of additional price surging technology to “dynamic” price during peak demand.\n\nFrom The Sun UK:\n\nCommenting on a LiveNation Facebook advert, one disgruntled fan wrote: “What a p**s take for all the genuine fans that bought tickets on release! Shame on you LiveNation and Ticketmaster.”\n\nThe anger was also shared on social media:\n\nThe Pearl Jam ticket saga is a case study. Pre-reg required for the privilege of having a chance to buy. Only some pre-reg got the link to buy. Panic on the day of sale – dynamic pricing driving prices up to €350 + on Ticketmaster. Today tix being sold for €50 on resell sites. — Alan Mulvey 🌻 (@al70) June 19, 2024\n\nI’l be there and at Manchester but likely to be my last time as feel ripped off by ticket prices. £160 each via 10c for seats at the back of the arena at Manchester, tickets now £63. Cancelled 10c membership too. Taking the piss too much now. — Andy Jardine (@AndyCricket100) June 15, 2024\n\nHad two emails from major ticket agencies trying to flog tickets for next weeks Pearl Jam shows🤔Prices seem to have fallen through the pitch😱Maybe stadium shows at mega prices were just a little too ambitious🤔 pic.twitter.com/L0gkbhxo5A — Phil Clarke 🤠 (@PhilTheRocker1) June 17, 2024\n\nSuch tactics have become the norm, and lead to things like a fan buying a cut-rate seat sitting in a prime location right next to someone who paid more than 10x more during the initial sales period – as happened during a poor-performing show on Bruce Springsteen’s tour last year. Tickets to that Tulsa gig had once been listed for more than $3,400 – and were directly adjacent to seats that were later reduced to $250.\n\n| READ MORE Tanking Tulsa Date Shows Springsteen Using Price Floors on Tour |\n\nThis phenomenon is not new – even Taylor Swift fans experienced it when high ticket prices caused demand to collapse for some dates on her Reputation tour, necessitating steep discounts and even large-scale giveaways to ensure seats weren’t empty when the star took the stage.\n\nPearl Jam fans are also uniquely sensitive to the feeling of being manipulated by the machinations of the ticketing machine, given the band’s very public stance against Ticketmaster in the 1990s. But it has become clear through their embrace of Ticketmaster’s dynamic pricing and transfer restriction systems that the band is all-in with Live Nation Entertainment and whatever its executives suggest.\n\nThe band’s tour is scheduled to continue through Europe for shows in late June and early July, with a second leg of North American dates scheduled to kick off in August and run through singer Eddie Vedder’s Ohana Festival in late September.

But first, the band had a favor to ask. It was April 9, 1994, and Pearl Jam was at the height of its fame after releasing “Vs.,” its second album. Days earlier, Nirvana frontman and fellow Seattle native Kurt Cobain had been found dead in his home from suicide, and Pearl Jam was still reeling. But when it came time to meet Clinton, the band members had a calculated request: They wanted him to join their war against Ticketmaster.\n\nMost presidents become accustomed to celebrity encounters and the favors that sometimes come with them. Kim Kardashian visited with Donald Trump to discuss prison reform. Elvis Presley offered Richard M. Nixon assistance on his anti-drug campaign.\n\nAnd 30 years ago, Pearl Jam asked for help at the start of a fight that’s still rocking the entertainment world today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Live Nation, the parent company of Ticketmaster since 2010, in an attempt to break up the entertainment giant. The Justice Department alleges the company has used its monopoly power to suppress competition. The lawsuit seeks to change the company’s business practices and essentially undo the 2010 merger.\n\nIt’s not the first time the Justice Department has investigated Ticketmaster. Back in 1994, when Pearl Jam was in the Oval Office with Clinton, the government was investigating the company for antitrust issues.\n\nAt the time, Pearl Jam was feuding with Ticketmaster after it was discovered that the company had been tacking fees onto its ticket sales and had added a service charge, which the company refused to waive, to a pair of charity concerts in Chicago. Meanwhile, the Cold War had ended a few years earlier, and the U.S. military had abandoned multiple bases across the country that it no longer needed. The situation gave Pearl Jam an idea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We were there specifically to find out whether some of the U.S. military bases that had recently been shut down could be used as concert sites,” frontman Eddie Vedder wrote in “Pearl Jam Twenty,” the band’s 2010 book. “It would have been a way to avoid using Ticketmaster, and it would have been a boon to local economics.”\n\nTicketmaster had deals with most of the country’s large music venues that required tickets to be sold through the company, but the bases would have no such obligation. The band hoped to be able to tour without Ticketmaster overcharging its fans, while helping towns reeling from the loss of the bases.\n\nThe musicians had reason to think Clinton would be receptive. His 1992 campaign had centered on the economy and the idea that the country could begin to spend domestically instead of on increased defense. Clinton was also a musician, having famously played saxophone on “The Arsenio Hall Show” in 1992.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Clinton, working with Pearl Jam made political sense, too.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n“It never hurts a president to be associated with a wicked cool band,” said Jeff Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University. Clinton was the first baby boomer president, “which means he’s the first president to have grown up with the existence of rock-and-roll. A large part of his appeal was the generational transition.”\n\nBut Clinton didn’t approve the plan.\n\n“This is something no one had really tried to do before,” said Steven Hyden, a music critic and author of “Long Road: Pearl Jam and the Soundtrack of a Generation.” He added, “In a way, I think it proved their point that this was a monopoly. Not even the most popular rock band in America at the time was able to work without this company. It really showed the amount of power and pull that Ticketmaster had at the time.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClinton had an agenda of his own at the meeting with Pearl Jam. He asked the band if the White House should put out a statement in response to Cobain’s death. But Vedder “was too shell-shocked to offer any help,” he wrote in “Pearl Jam Twenty.”\n\nThe band’s White House visit ultimately ended with a conversation about the University of Arkansas’s national basketball championship victory over Duke days earlier, which both Clinton — a big Razorbacks fan — and Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament had attended in Charlotte.\n\nPearl Jam returned to Washington two months later to testify before Congress about its battle with Ticketmaster. Ament and rhythm guitarist Stone Gossard testified that Ticketmaster used monopolistic practices to raise prices, prompting Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) to write a bill requiring ticket distributors to disclose the fees they add to ticket prices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, the Justice Department dropped its investigation of Ticketmaster, and Pearl Jam canceled its 1994 tour in protest of the company. Dingell’s bill failed, and the midterm elections that fall gave the Republicans control of both congressional chambers for the first time in 40 years. When Dingell reintroduced the bill in 1995, the band met unsuccessfully with powerful Republican senators in an attempt to sway the vote.\n\nPearl Jam continued to boycott Ticketmaster by refusing to play venues the company had contracts with, or by hosting charity events and benefits because Ticketmaster’s contracts generally had a clause allowing bands to sell their own tickets for such performances.\n\n“It’s really unique for an artist who is at the peak of their commercial success to essentially take a hatchet to the music industry,” Hyden said. “Usually, a band in their position would be trying to tour arenas or stadiums and maximize their moment for as much money as possible. And they really did the opposite. They sacrificed a lot of money and in a way alienated their fans because they weren’t able to tour as much as they would have if they just played ball.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch has changed in the 30 years since Pearl Jam’s meeting with Clinton. Ticketmaster has been involved in multiple controversies, including when its website crashed during Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour presale in 2022, and it’s fair to wonder how Pearl Jam’s scheme to circumvent Ticketmaster would have gone over had it been pitched more recently.\n\nLast month, Pearl Jam released its 12th album, “Dark Matter,” and the band’s war against ticket prices is still going strong. Recently speaking on “The Bill Simmons Podcast,” Vedder floated the idea of new legislation to protect customers.', 'title': 'Pearl Jam asked Bill Clinton to take on Ticketmaster 30 years ago', 'top_image': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6D5PZ7PLSZBJTD45B6PRIHNAGU.jpg&w=1440', 'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2024/05/24/pearl-jam-bill-clinton-ticketmaster/', 'keywords': [...], 'summary': 'Pearl Jam was at the White House, and President Bill Clinton wanted some advice from the musicians.\nIt was April 9, 1994, and Pearl Jam was at the height of its fame after releasing “Vs.,” its second album.\nDays earlier, Nirvana frontman and fellow Seattle native Kurt Cobain had been found dead in his home from suicide, and Pearl Jam was still reeling.\nAnd 30 years ago, Pearl Jam asked for help at the start of a fight that’s still rocking the entertainment world today.\nPearl Jam returned to Washington two months later to testify before Congress about its battle with Ticketmaster.'}, {'author': '', 'base': 'https://www.nbcchicago.com', 'provider': None, 'published_date': '2024-02-13T14:09:30+00:00', 'text': 'Chicago\'s concert scene for 2024 just got a little grungier.\n\nAccording to an announcement from Live Nation, Seattle grunge band Pearl Jam has announced a 2024 world tour with a two-night stop in Chicago at Wrigley Field.

The iconic Evenflow singers have confirmed the existence of their 12th studio album, Dark Matter, and its release date. Dark Matter will be released later this year on April 19, 2024, marking their first new record since 2020\'s Gigaton. That\'s not all, though. Pearl Jam also announced an enormous world tour will be taking place throughout 2024. During this, they\'ll be hitting Europe, the Americas and Australia. Eddie Vedder was ecstatic about the return, as he commented: "I’m getting chills, because I have good memories. We’re still looking for ways to communicate. We’re at this time in our lives when you could do it or you could not do it, but we still care about putting something out there that is meaningful and we hopefully think is our best work. No hyperbole, I think this is our best work."\n\n"We still care about putting something out there that is meaningful and we, hopefully, think is our best work" - Eddie Vedder\n\nBassist Jeff Ament agreed with Vedder\'s comments, adding: "What Ed said about getting us in a room at this point, we felt like we were about to make a really important record. A lot of that had to do with the atmosphere Andrew set up. He has encyclopedic knowledge of our history, not only as a band and how we wrote songs, but as players. "He could pinpoint things we did on old songs to the point where I was like, ‘What the fuck is he talking about?’ His excitement was contagious. He’s a force. I just want to say thanks for keeping us on track. I couldn’t be prouder of us as a band. I feel so grateful for the fans, but mostly for my brothers and these people I’ve made music with."
